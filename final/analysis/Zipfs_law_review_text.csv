"&quot;Charlie's Angels&quot; is dedicated to the proposition that you can have your cheesecake and eat it, too. Its three heroines, played with varying degrees of swagger and sultriness by Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore, are meant to appeal both to teenage girls, who will admire their professionalism and fighting spirit, and to teenage boys, who will find other things about them to admire. Unfortunately, this loud, trashy updating of the 70's television show isn't as much fun as it should be, despite Ms. Diaz's spirited comic performance. The Hong Kong-style action sequences are lamely edited and staged, and the film swings wildly between tiresome intentional self-parody and the unintentional kind, which is even more annoying. &#151; A.

"A mild but amusing remake of &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan.&quot; This time the not-so-bright guy who dies so that he can learn a spiritual lesson is Lance, a failed comedian (Chris Rock), who comes back as a pudgy white plutocrat whose chad probably fell for Dubya. The plot complications include Lance's trying to court an African-American social activist (Regina King) while he's trapped in the body of a white man, and still get onstage at the Apollo. There are a few funny ideas, which are reminiscent of the deadly riffing that Rock is capable of, and he shows new confidence as an actor. This picture, by the directors of &quot;American Pie,&quot; doesn't quite work as a romantic comedy: it's a little timid and recycled, despite some great supporting performances by Eugene Levy, Wanda Sykes and Mark Addy. — Elvis Mitchell",44,1

"&quot;Kill by Inches,&quot; written and directed by Diane Doniol-Valcroze and Arthur Flam, is an American independent film with a European sensibility.  It tells the highly stylized story of Thomas Klamm (the gifted French actor Emmanuel Salinger), an earnest young tailor toiling away on what must be the last deserted street in the otherwise bustling Brooklyn neighborhood around the Manhattan Bridge. Thomas was severely traumatized as a young boy when his authoritarian father (Marcus Powell), also a tailor, forced him to eat every inch of his tape measure as punishment. Ever since, Thomas has been possessed by a kind of metric voyeurism in which he finds a sexual thrill in the measurement of human bodies. – Dave Kehr",62,1

"There are more ways than one to view this luminous directorial debut of Gyorgi Palfi, a Hungarian filmmaker whose intensified, child's-eye apprehension of the natural world might be described as psychedelic. If you're attracted to pure, exquisitely photographed cinematic depictions of the world, you could almost lie down in &quot;Hukkle&quot; as if it were a meadow and soak in its sun-drenched atmosphere.  But as the movie builds up its bucolic vision, it also teases you with enigmatic clues to an actual murder in the rural Hungarian village where it takes place. If you enjoy the challenge of solving difficult mysteries, &quot;Hukkle&quot; presents a tantalizing case waiting to be cracked.  By the end of &quot;Hukkle,&quot; the images of violence and predation have erased the mood of benignity, and the rumbling bass notes of this pastoral symphony evoke a sustained moan of despair. &#151; Stephen Holden",77,1

"This comedy revolves around a stolen nuclear device that looks &quot;like a garbage disposal&quot; and passes from one set of inept hands to another. The device's movement and the people in contact with it make up the plot. The movie's inclusion of a hijacked airliner carrying an atomic bomb resulted in a delay of its scheduled release last fall. Barry Sonnenfeld seems to be working as much as a cartoonist as anything else, but it doesn't  play  as well here as it did in his &quot;Men in Black,&quot; which actually came from a comic book. &quot;Trouble&quot; is a little slipshod; it's as if the director is doing a movie version of Cracked magazine instead of Mad Magazine. — Elvis Mitchell",80,1

"Set on the last day of summer camp in 1981, this loosey-goosey collection of bits and gags is both a homage to and a parody of the cheesy, dumb, low-brow comedies of that era. It works better as homage, since crude, silly jokes don't gain much by being delivered with a wink of referential knowingness. The humor is a combination of improvisational absurdity and bawdy adolescent mugging, and it starts to get old after about 45 minutes, but there is enough to satisfy anyone who was an obnoxious 15-year-old in the early years of the Reagan presidency, which may be enough to make the movie a minor hit. - A.

"Not even Janet McTeer, one of the world's most resourceful actresses, can rescue this movie from its steady deterioration from a chilly study of Britons quietly going mad at a remote Asian trading station into a clanking melodrama rife with murder and suicide. Ms. McTeer plays the divorced  older fiancée of a handsome young surveyor seeking his fortune in the Malayan jungle in 1924. The trading station where the unlucky couple find themselves is a shabby, insect-infested hellhole deep in the rain and ruled with an iron hand by the greedy, tight-fisted widow (Brenda Fricker) of its founder. Skulking around the property are her sullen ne'er-do-well son (Tony Maudsley), his demented former nanny (Olympia Dukakis) and other desperate characters. At first the movie presents a convincingly claustrophobic vision of a  tiny rotting community desperately trying to keep itself together. But as the shocks come  thicker and faster, the movie's credibility wears away. — Stephen Holden",95,1

"Jackie Chan is one of the great physical comedians, and this martial arts western spoof is a high-spirited, marvelously silly showcase for his talents. Mr. Chan plays Chon Wang, an Imperial Guard dispatched from Beijing to the Old West to rescue a princess played by Lucy Liu. But the heart of the movie is the interplay between Mr. Chan and Owen Wilson, who depicts his inept outlaw sidekick with goofy, spacey charm. After the glum bullying of ''Gladiator'' and the noisy bombast of ''M:I-2,'' it's refreshing to see a movie so good-natured, so confident in its ability to provoke not queasy awe or numb exhaustion, but pure delight. &#151 A.

"This wildly inventive, richly expressionistic movie imagines Adolf Hitler (Noah Taylor) as an ambitious young painter in 1918 Munich. John Cusack is Max Rothman, a fictional German-Jewish art dealer, avowed modernist and proto-bohemian who advises him. If Mr. Taylor gives a human dimension to one of history's monsters, his Hitler still emerges as a thoroughly disagreeable creep. The movie comes up with the novel notion that Nazism originated as an art project. Well-acted and strikingly designed, &quot;Max&quot; doesn't pretend to be an accurate account of the past. At heart, it's a provocative aesthetic dialogue on art history. — Stephen Holden",137,1

He plays Barry Egan, an awkward, volatile bathroom-supply salesman who collects pudding in his spare time and who is harassed by his seven sisters and ensnared in a phone sex extortion scam. Into the chaos of Barry's life — brilliantly orchestrated by Mr. Anderson, with help from John Brion, who composed the swooning, percussive score — comes Lena Leonard (Emily Watson), who falls in love with him for no good reason. Which is fitting, since this movie delights in its own irrational, exuberant romanticism, and will leave you in a flushed, intoxicated state best captured by its title. — A. O. Scott",158,1

"This visually handsome, fact-filled biography of Martin Luther depicts the events that gave birth to Reformation as a life-and-death political  struggle between a corrupt, repressive, intransigently conservative establishment (the  Roman Catholic Church) and a liberal populist movement that spins out of control and wreaks havoc. As the film veers uncertainly between meticulous historical recapitulation  and shameless hokiness, it brings in enough characters to populate a mini-series. When the  historical detail becomes too confusing, the movie shamelessly overcompensates by  wallowing in cheap sentimentality. Although Joseph Fiennes's performance captures  Luther's psychic and spiritual turbulence, the character never quite achieves a full human  dimension. — Stephen Holden",188,1

Dominic's devotion to Bella takes an extreme turn when, learning that the old woman will soon die of cancer, he schemes to bring back her estranged daughter (Kristin Minter) and marry her, to fulfill the old girl's dream.  The picture is pretty much of a mess, full of narrative gaps and unexplained motivations, but it is a sweet, good-natured mess. — Dave Kehr",197,1

"This unusual and remarkable film has a premise so simple that, in the abstract, it borders on the banal: plotless and stubbornly resistant to conventional narrative structure, the movie has its camera follow students around the halls and grounds of a  high school in Portland, Ore., for a day until violence  erupts.  &quot;Elephant&quot; is the director Gus Van Sant's take on the murders that took place at Columbine High School.  The title comes from the British director Alan Clarke's 1989 rough-and-ready short film of the same name, a tough and dense look at the   violence in northern Ireland, which also didn't paste answers onto the  problem. Mr. Clarke's short outraged or absorbed viewers in the way Mr. Van  Sant's movie, which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, is likely to do. (Mr. Clarke's title referred to the aphorism about the elephant in the living room — a problem that people refuse to face for so long that they are no longer even able to  see it.) &quot;Elephant&quot; will confound audiences looking for solutions or villains, because it doesn't supply them. There's no narrator perched  omnisciently over the events, nor the kinds of exaggerated melodramatics  and pop music that teen movies employ to insistently nag at emotions. There are few recognizable actors, since Mr. Van Sant populated the movie with   kids who had never acted before, heightening the realism and the tension. Mr. Van Sant gives &quot;Elephant&quot; a Spartan yet elusive life by shifting the film's focus from one group of  students to another; the camera actually drifts like a bored high school student.  And by the end of the movie, we realize where much of the power and clarity of the film comes  from. By making the camera an observer, we get a perspective  that often comes out of horror movies, a choice that whips the ordinary  with the terrifying —  an unforgettable mix. — Elvis Mitchell",202,1

"The title of this romantic comedy refers to a popular Filipino dish whose ingredients include pork, vinegar, garlic and fish sauce and whose ritual preparation regularly brings together five Filipino-American friends around a dinner table in Queens. The dish becomes an overwrought metaphor for group dynamics and cultural assimilation.

By the end of the film, the intersecting dramas and histrionic performances have spilled all over the floor, so to speak. – Stephen Holden",224,1

"Having made three wildly successful, popular movies in a row, Steven Soderbergh indulges his experimental impulses, making a movie as abstruse and disjunctive as his earlier &quot;Schizopolis.&quot; The impulse is, in its way, an admirable one. The director — one of the smartest working in Hollywood today  — does not want to play it safe, or risk boring himself, but the result is an arch, convoluted mess. Julia Roberts and Blair Underwood play two movie stars who star in a movie within a movie, which is shot on film in contrast to the grainy digital video that records the surrounding reality. The point, though, is that nothing is real, that life in and around the movies is made of lies, willed self-deceptions and endless narcissism. Point taken. — A. O. Scott",234,1

The direction is sometimes plodding: the madcap decadence of Jazz Age Hollywood never really comes alive, But the acting is first rate, and the picture shows an appealing sympathy for its vain, self-absorbed characters, no matter how monstrously or ridiculously they behave. — A.

(He hasn't even cheated on his wife yet, although he wants to.) Rahda Mitchell is Stu's pretty blond wife, Katie Holmes his  prospective girlfriend, Forest Whitaker, the police captain who tries coax him out of the  booth, and Kiefer Sutherland the sniper's telephone voice.

"Those of us looking for the opportunity to compare a Martin Lawrence turn to a Robert Redford performance based on the same character &#151; Donald E. Westlake's determined bad guy John Dortmunder &#151; still have a while to wait. In the new film adaptation of the author's &quot;What's the Worst That Could Happen?,&quot; Mr. Westlake's skillful but hapless Dortmunder, portrayed by Mr. Redford in 1972 in &quot;The Hot Rock,&quot; is transformed into the latest of Mr. Lawrence's bungling, bling-blinging protagonists. This time, Mr. Lawrence is a professional thief who becomes obsessed with Danny DeVito, a white-collar criminal. The picture turns into a cobweb of tricky spins and twists that seems like a hip-hop of version of &quot;Ruthless People,&quot; with everyone falling back on his specialty. With its set of cliches, the movie is a dreary walk down comedy's memory lane. Mr. Lawrence has added to his delivery a layer of dry ice that almost freezes the others out entirely. Fortunately, his cool can't insulate him from Bernie Mac, who plays his fence, Uncle Jack, as if he already owns the picture and is scouting for the best price he can get. But if Uncle Jack bursts onto the screen, it's William Fichtner's rococo turn that's hard to watch and take your eyes off. He saunters in on a cloud of proud but indeterminate sexuality, with hair made of lemon spun sugar. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",297,1
"Of all the odd couples who inhabit film, surely among the most endearing are Jennifer and Randall, the lost souls and repressed good hearts at the sweet, sentimental center of Christine Lahti's life-affirming film. As Jennifer and Randall, Leelee Sobieski and Albert Brooks, especially Mr. Brooks, deliver outstanding performances in the first feature film to be directed by Ms. Lahti. Jennifer is 17, a black-clad, metal-pierced, acid-tongued, death-obsessed, tattoo-inked, self-mutilating yet poetically inclined cactus of an outsider. Randall is 49 and couldn't seem more different. Neatly dressed, orderly, long divorced, he runs a Brooks Brothers-like men's clothing store in an expansive Los Angeles shopping mall. Before the end, Jennifer and Randall are going to become the best of friends. - Lawrence Van Gelder",298,1

Accepted as hip, ironic and liberating by mainstream audiences but reviled by black militants, it starts a national craze for wearing blackface. If this messy cinematic collage goes every which way, its anger at a television industry that largely excludes blacks and whose black programming (in the director's view) perpetuates minstrelsy is right on target.

"Every once in a while, a movie comes through with a daring brand of emotional and filmmaking honesty that redefines the medium: &quot;Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights&quot; is not such a movie. This reimagining of the recklessly melodramatic 1987 original is packed with flashy, taffeta silliness, and a desperation for a sweaty PG-13 sexiness so laughable that the cast members deserve Oscar nominations for getting through the picture without cracking up. The film is set in 1958. Teenaged Katey Miller (Romola Garai) has just moved to Havana with her family; her father, Bert (John Slattery), has gone to work for Ford in Cuba. A nervous, repressed bookworm, Katie wraps her arms around her torso and wears a black cardigan as she sits by the pool. Enter the foxy, sultry Javier (Diego Luna), a busboy whom Katey accidentally disgraces when she knocks over his tray of drinks. When she rushes to pay for the beverages, he bats his lush eyelashes and hisses, &quot;I don't need your charity.&quot; Of course, this unfortunate introduction leads them down the path of love and a dance contest. — Elvis Mitchell",325,1

"When this small, exquisitely acted Canadian film, is observing the psychological tensions  of three grown-up sisters attending their dying, devoutly Catholic mother in a small Nova  Scotia town, it uncovers a complexity and depth of feeling rarely glimpsed in a family  drama. The story is filtered through the sensibility of Agnes (Molly Parker), the restless  youngest sister and the family's black sheep who is in shaky recovery from alcohol and  cocaine addiction. The oldest, Theresa (Rebecca Jenkins), is a grim, long-suffering refugee  from a failed marriage; the middle sister, Louise (Stacy Smith), an undeclared lesbian. But  once the movie has laid out its characters and their histories, it doesn't know where to  take them, and its contrived confrontations take on a stagy clank. — Stephen Holden",339,1

Mr. Cuesta explores the queasy ambiguities of Howie and Big John's relationship with an impressively delicate touch, but Big John's perverse charisma leaves the picture with no place to go. Once Howie's predicament reaches a critical point, the filmmakers, as if speeding toward the nearest exit, wrap up the story with a big emotional confrontation and a burst of violence that is all the more unconvincing for seeming morally justified. &#151; A.

He is given to long-winded, self-righteous denunciations of his fellow humans for what he perceives as their blind conformism, which makes him a very irritating person to be around.  Frequent cutaways to soaring sea gulls suggest that Spoddy is a spirit in desperate need of liberation.  &quot;Attitude&quot; is the fifth installment in a series of works that Rob Nilsson has created with the Tenderloin Group, an actors' workshop that he helped to create at a halfway house in San Francsico's Tenderloin district.

"Lar's von Trier's musical, shot in raw, jumpy digital video, is a fascinating exercise in brutality, mitigated by the otherworldy charisma (and the music) of the Icelandic pop star Bjork. As Selma, a Czech immigrant factory worker going blind in the early 1960's in Washington State (the film was shot in Sweden), Bjork seems to be inventing a whole new style of film acting, and her performance is miraculous. von Trier, continuing his campaign to rescue the art of film from complacency and convention, follows Selma's utter annihilation with sadistic relish. &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; is both stupefyingly bad and utterly overpowering; it can elicit, sometimes within a single scene, a gasp of rapture and a spasm of revulsion. Come to the theater prepared, with a handkerchief in one hand and a rotten tomato in the other. -- A. O. Scott",399,1

His last film, ''Madadayo,'' released in Japan in 1993, lacks the narrative intensity of emotional range to be considered among his masterpieces, but within its own modest proportions it achieves a kind of perfection. The story is not much: a retired professor in postwar Tokyo lives out his twilight years in the glow of his former students' devotion and declares his unreadiness to say farewell to the life he lives with humor and gusto. But Kurosawa's absolute assurance as a filmmaker and his unabashed affection for his characters make ''Madadayo'' a richly, and in a way inexplicably, satisfying movie. &#151; A. O. Scott",421,1

"&quot;Russian Ark&quot; is a magnificent conjuring act, an eerie historical mirage evoked in a single sweeping wave of the hand by Alexander Sokurov. The 96-minute film, shot in high-definition video in the Hermitage at St. Petersburg, consists of one continuous, uninterrupted take. Thanks to recent technological innovation, it is the longest unbroken shot in the history of film. As the Steadicam floats through the museum's galleries, a cast of 2,000 actors and extras act out random, whimsical moments of Russian imperial history that dissolve into one other like chapters of a dream. Mr. Sokurov, who has always been drawn to historical subjects, has said that he wanted to capture &quot;the flow of time&quot; in a pure cinematic language that suggests &quot;a single breath.&quot; And that's what &quot;Russian Ark&quot; accomplishes. — Stephen Holden",436,1

"It actually seems a sadly appropriate exercise of corporate short-sightedness that, just after Disney announced it was shutting down its Florida-based animation studios and bringing to a close the era of hand-drawn animation, the studio releases &quot;Teacher's Pet.&quot; This marvelously quick-witted and gloriously goofy hand-drawn feature shows that there's still more than 21 grams of life left in the form. It helps when the drawn stuff has a touch of individuality, and the artist Gary Baseman — creator of both the Saturday morning cartoon show and this sure-footed, blessedly swift movie that was derived from it — couldn't be more idiosyncratic. Nathan Lane's shameless vocal theatrics is a perfect fit for the character he voices, Spot, a relentlessly chatty blue dog whose ambition to be a human boy instead of a doggy is realized by slipping into a pair of shorts, a bright yellow short-sleeved shirt and  a pair of glasses. When Spot hears about Dr. Krank (Kelsey Grammer), the mad scientist who has perfected the technology of turning animals into humans, he scampers off to Florida to undergo treatment. &quot;Teacher's Pet&quot; will reward your close attention with a gratifyingly high ratio of humor. It gets more laughs out of 74 minutes than many recent live-action comedies with much more time. — Elvis Mitchell",460,1

The film brings Jimmy (Mr. Dillon), as an insurance salesman, to the attention of federal agents investigating a $10 million insurance fraud that has left victims of a hurricane without compensation. Jimmy disclaims knowledge of the whereabouts of his mysterious boss, Marvin (Jaames Caan). In fact, Jimmy's conscience is troubled by the impact of the fraud on the hurricane victims; he knows that Marvin, who is more to him than an employer, is in Cambodia, and he sets out to find him.

"In this sardonic psychological thriller, Sandra Bonnaire portrays a Gallic answer to one of Alfred Hitchcock's sleek blond women of mystery. Imagine the Grace Kelly of &quot;Rear Window&quot; or the Kim Novak of &quot;Vertigo&quot; sprawled seductively on an analyst's couch, smoking cigarettes and confiding her sexual frustration to a repressed, wide-eyed shrink who is obsessed with her. The movie establishes a mood of playful erotic suspense in the first 10 minutes and sustains its cat-and-mouse game between therapist and patient through variations that are by turns amusing, titillating and mildly scary. The running joke is its revelation at the outset that the shrink (Fabrice Luchini) is not really a therapist but a repressed, lonely tax accountant.  Ms. Bonnaire's troubled character has accidentally strayed into the wrong office, located  on the same floor where the psychoanalyst she intended to consult practices a few doors  away.  The movie takes place less in the real world than in the realm of voyeuristic fantasy, in other words, in the realm of film itself. In the spirit of the best Hitchcock, it is seriously light. Or is it lightly serious? — Stephen Holden",557,1

But his best friend from childhood, the successful gangster Yanis (Mr. Naceri), wants Dris in on a big armored car heist he is planning, and assigns the Gypsy prostitute Nina (Clotilde Courau, a burgeoning Jennifer Jones-type) to rekindle her old romance with Dris and pull him back into the fold.

Thus are nations united.

"Jennifer Connelly plays Cathy Nicolo, a recovering addict whose modest house on the California coast is seized by the county, and sold at auction to Massoud Behrani (Ben Kingsley), a former Iranian military officer living in gloomy exile with his family. Cathy's attempt to get back the house and Behrani's intransigent refusal to let go of it escalate toward a heavily foreshadowed catastrophe. The movie, adapted from a novel by Andre Dubus III, is the nearly flawed execution of a deeply flawed premise. The logic of the story seems to override the plausible motives of the characters, and you may feel the overwhelming force of the tragic ending without quite believing it. Ms. Connelly is a bit blank, her intelligence trapped by Cathy's passivity, but Mr. Kingsley, playing a patriarch in crisis, is superb. So are Ron Eldard, as the sheriff s deputy whose attempts to help Cathy accelerate the inevitable disaster, and especially Shohreh Aghdashloo, who plays Behrani's weary, good-hearted wife. Vadim Perelman, directing his first feature film, shows himself to be a filmmaker of impressive tact and restraint.

"Denys Arcand reassembles many of the same lustful, left-wing French-Canadian intellectuals who populated &quot;Decline of the American Empire,&quot; his 1986 comedy of intellectual grandiosity and sexual duplicity. This time, the bawdy talk and political banter is shadowed by mortality, and by the rueful awareness that history has had the last laugh. Rémy (Rémy Girard) is dying of cancer, and friends, former lovers and his estranged wife gather around his death bed for a long, sentimental seminar replete with naughty jokes and wistful nostalgia. Joining them are two members of the younger generation, Rémy's son, Sébastien (Stéphane Rousseau), a wealthy international banker, and Nathalie (Marie-Josée Crozee), a heroin addict, who lack both the bravado and the narcissism of their parents. What makes this more than a facile study in generational conflict is Mr. Arcand's acute sense of history: he has made the cultural contradictions of global capitalism into the material of a heartfelt domestic drama that is also a broad, accessible and devilishly funny sex farce. — A.

Scenes roll by of villages massacred, nuns raped and murdered, children maimed and tortured, and politicians assassinated, all apparently at the hands of soldiers trained by the school or under the leadership of its graduates. The film's title comes from Noam Chomsky's description of the program  &#151;  while everyone is looking for the secret tools of American influence, its physical plant is there for everyone to see.  Mr. Smihula's documentary is a sober, concentrated film that asks Americans to take another look at what is going on in their own backyard. &#151; Dave Kehr",791,1

This documentary  is essentially about merging the Old World and the New, but with a twist that is shocking: it concerns the heartfelt desire of homosexuals to find a place for themselves in Orthodox Judaism, where they are  shunned and repudiated. The film tells several stories, profiling a number of people. Mr. DuBowski knows that the film would shatter if his viewpoint were rendered in hysterical terms or even condescending ones.

"This vehicle for the Chinese beauty Gong Li finds her approaching 40 but still playing a young, innocent peasant woman: Zhou Yu, a painter in a ceramics factory who twice a week takes a crowded train from her home in Sanming, an industrial center in the northwest, to the rural village of Chongyang.  She makes the punishing journey to see her lover, Chen Ching (Tony Leung Ka Fai), a shy, sensitive poet who lives in reclusion in a dusty library.  Built out of bits and pieces of successful Chinese films of the recent past, &quot;Zhou Yu's Train&quot; comes to seem less a movie than a memory of movies &#151; or at worst, a commercial Frankenstein's monster, sewn together to fill a perceived gap in the market.  The Chinese cinema has since gone on to more challenging, socially-engaged subjects (as in Zhang Ke Jia's amazing &quot;Platform&quot;); perhaps it's time for Ms. Li to do the same. &#151; Dave Kehr",811,1

"This film floats one of the least posed and, therefore, most important  cinematic questions of our time: Can a movie maintain the dramatic integrity of a theme-park ride? In the case of Gore Verbinski's film, the answer is sure. Mr. Verbinski's penchant for logistics combined with the producer Jerry Bruckheimer's desire to spend like a drunken pirate when it comes to putting everything onscreen melt into an often frenetic, colorful and entertaining comic adventure. The dazzling, high-flying silliness is quite an achievement:  the movie is better than it deserves to be, given its origins. In fact, there's enough storyline for several movies. The wiry and beauteous tomboy Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) owns a medallion that gets the plot going roughly a scant hour into &quot;Pirates.&quot; The pirate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) kidnaps Elizabeth because of the medallion, which turns out to be an enchanted piece of gold that can free Barbossa and his swabbies from their curse. They're the larcenous undead whose skeletons can be seen in the moonlight. But the movie belongs to Johnny Depp as the pirate Capt. Jack Sparrow. Gargling his consonants before spitting them out, Mr. Depp suggests a man who has spent either a great deal of time with Keith Richards after a tour of the Rebel Yell factory, or a man who has spent a great deal of time watching Mike Myers do his Keith Richards impression. — Elvis Mitchell",820,1

"&quot;Have you ever been to a movie?&quot; Tim Allen asks Christian Slater in this vaporous crime-comedy, a picture that makes you wonder if the writer-director Chris Ver Wiel has done anything but go to the movies. The movie is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost. It starts with a pair of hitmen stalking Finch (Mr. Slater), whom they mistakenly believe to be Cletis Tout, a reporter marked by the mob. The gunmen, who are there to do the job, are bantering about films, relishing the fine points of some mildly diverting dialogue in &quot;Deliverance.&quot; But wait, there's more — Mr. Allen materializes, playing a supreme assassin who &quot;loves two things,&quot; his profession and movies.

It is, instead, a long march to the slaughterhouse that seems to take forever to get going and, once it does, goes nowhere that hasn't been visited before by more talented filmmakers.  The plot, such as it is, kicks in when a van full of early 70's hippies stumbles into the remote farmhouse owned by the Hooper clan — crazed rednecks who, in the original version, represented a nightmare vision of Richard Nixon's Middle America, but who here represent little other than stereotypes in the service of sadism.

Madonna plays the spoiled wife of a pharmaceutical magnate (Bruce Greenwood) and Adriano Giannini, in a role originated by his father, Giancarlo, is the rough-hewn fisherman with whom she is stranded on a deserted Mediterranean island. What happens there is meant to be a harrowing comedy of sex and power, but in Mr. Ritchie's bored, inept hands it turns into a very long Club Med commercial, though in general those commercials have more eroticism and greater political insight than this soggy piece of flotsam. — A.

Watching this messy epic feels a little like being jammed into an un-air-conditioned subway car on a steamy summer night as it rattles through an urban wasteland. At any second, things could explode. And eventually they do. It is the 1980's, and the setting is Sao Paolo's real-life House of Detention, which was torn down in 2002, a decade after a riot led to the massacre of 111 inmates by the police. The film is a splashy return to form by the celebrated director of  &quot;Pixote&quot; and &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman.&quot; In examining social ills, it interweaves multiple stories of the prisoners' lives as viewed by a doctor volunteering his services.  Below its documentary-like sprawl, &quot;Carandiru&quot; is a hands-on movie passionately engaged in its characters' personal dramas. Just when it threatens to go soft, it erupts in what may be the most horrific prison riot ever filmed. — Stephen Holden",1016,1

"Most of this weird-for-weird's-sake film is set inside the recesses of a cluttered store for movie props, where Chep (Michael Pitt), a pathologically shy young clerk, lives and works. The film observes his courtship of a movie production designer and fellow weirdo (Paige Turco) whose obsession with authenticity leads her to  request such items as a vintage prosthetic arm made of mahogany and a pair of genuine  rhinoceros eyes. Mr. Pitt, the movies' arty male ingénue of the moment, plays his character's cowering intensity for all it's worth. But his performance isn't quite enough to make the movie, written and directed by David Cronenberg's nephew, more than a promising curiosity. In the movie's flashiest visual reference, Chep slaps on a rubber mask of the wrestler-turned-star Tor Johnson from Ed Wood's movie &quot;Plan 9 From Outer Space.&quot; It sends a signal that &quot;Plan 9&quot; is the kind of cult movie that &quot;Rhinoceros Eyes&quot; aspires to be. &#151; Stephen Holden",1028,1

"Most of the meager charms of this chaotic romantic farce spring from the deft comic contortions of Hollywood's ultimate nerdy sidekick, Jason Lee. As Paul Morse, a Seattle ad salesman about to marry his boss's daughter, Karen (Selma Blair), this 32-year-old actor expands from the blandly goofy Keanu-manqué he often plays into a variation on the comic leading man Ben Stiller has made into a specialty. Paul's troubles begin the morning after his bachelor party, when he discovers a strange young woman (Julia Stiles) lying next to him in bed. &quot;A Guy Thing&quot; was adapted from a story by Greg Glienna, one of the writers of  &quot;Meet the Parents,&quot; and much of it plays like a confused, desperate rehash of that hit comedy. — Stephen Holden",1037,1

"This film is bound to attract potential audiences if only because it may have the only title that gets more mentions than &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; on CNN. Yet director Moshen Makhmalbaf's picture is worthy of some attention because it happens to deal with the culture of the area Afghanistan in forceful and dramatic terms. &quot;Kanhadar&quot; deals with the treatment of women under Taliban rule, and sends an Afghan woman, Nafas (Nelofer Pazira), who had left Afghanistan, back to home to find her troubled sister. Mr. Makhmalbaf isn't much of a storyteller, and Ms. Pazira, a television journalist in Canada, is more than his equal in her lack of acting ability. She has the command of someone who is accustomed to siting before the camera; she hold positions as if she was born to be there, and the film plays like a surrealist melodrama made by a man with an intuitive understanding of emotion, if not narrative. – Elvis Mitchell",1051,1

"Apparently the only thing tougher than endurance on the frontier is sitting through a movie about endurance on the frontier — at least that's the point &quot;The Missing&quot; is determined to make. Amazingly, what it also seems to be saying is that 40 years after John Ford's 1956 &quot;The Searchers,&quot; we've arrived at a point in film history in which the movie industry can only offer a less sophisticated version of the same material. Overly sensitive and disdainful of her tough life, Lilly (Evan Rachel Wood) longs to escape the grim cabin she shares with her healer mother, Maggie (Cate Blanchett), and little sister, Dot (Jenna Boyd). Lilly gets away from home in a way she never bargained for — she's kidnapped by a group of renegade Indians who plan to sell her once they cross the border into Mexico. Just before Lilly is snatched away, Maggie's estranged father (Tommy Lee Jones) returns home: there's already tension in the household. When the worst happens, Maggie is forced to team with her father to track down her daughter. But &quot;The Missing&quot; leaves out the sexual paranoia that John Wayne's face reflected; he was eaten alive by the possibility that his abducted niece had become sexually involved with her captors. Despite torrents of brutality, there's no danger of rape from the scrupulous villains in &quot;The Missing.&quot; As a result, this is a movie that only exists from the shoulders up. It's an intriguing way for Ron Howard to play to his chief strength — and interests — the knotty and peculiar emotional cross-currents that buffet a family. And  for a time, before it shifts into the thriller aspect of the story, &quot;The Missing&quot; feels like a thoughtful attempt to focus on the strains of home life.   After the mission of &quot;The Missing&quot; begins, however, the movie starts to feel like an episode of Stephen King's &quot;Little House on the Prairie.&quot; — Elvis Mitchell",1061,1

"The fiction film debut of the director Chuck Workman, best known for the snappy compilations of film clips that have often enlivened the  Academy Award presentations.  Where Mr. Workman's shorts skip merrily from title to title and decade to decade, his attempt to patch together a drama from a number of story fragments and briefly glimpsed characters in &quot;A House on a Hill&quot; ends in shallowness and confusion.  His central character, Harry Mayfield (played by the reliably authentic Philip Baker Hall), is a brilliant but neglected architect who identifies with the Frank Lloyd Wright-ish figure played by Gary Cooper in King Vidor's 1949 adaptation of &quot;The Fountainhead,&quot; a notion introduced, naturally enough, by a well-chosen film clip.  He has been summoned out of cranky semi-retirement by a wealthy young woman, Kate Banks (Rebecca Staab), to build a house for herself and her heartless yuppie husband on the site of what was to have been Mayfield's own dream home, which he lost in a tragic fire that also claimed the life of his son. &quot;A House on a Hill&quot; struggles with large issues but  unlike, say, Vidor's 1949 film,  does not find characters of an equivalent scale or dramatic moments of a sufficient impact to communicate its concerns. — Dave Kehr",1157,1

"Miguel Arteta's crooked comedy of manners is like a Bette Davis melodrama directed by Luis Buñuel: ambition and heartache with a poisonous undercurrent of anti-bourgeois absurdity. And it's a winner, helped along by a no-frills performance by Jennifer Aniston as the soul-sick cashier Justine. When Justine stares into the big, droopy eyes of Holden (Jake Gyllenhaal), a new employee who wears his voluble, depressive air like the Red Badge of Courage, she's enchanted. In his early 20's and still living at home, Holden is smitten by Justine's  worldliness, even though when he tells her he was named after the protagonist of &quot;The Catcher in the Rye,&quot; she asks if his name is Catcher. &quot;The Good Girl&quot; is like a neurotically charged post-millennial take on the trailer-park comedies that Jonathan Demme once claimed for himself. — Elvis Mitchell",1213,1

"Sylvain Chomet's ravishingly weird animated feature unfolds in a universe of sheer impossibility, where size, proportion and balance are ruled by the whims of the director's perverse pen and his peculiar imagination. Although that imagination has evidently been fed by sources as various as Betty Boop, Jacques Tati and European comic books, its products are too strange to be assimilated into any known tradition. The plot is too bizarre for summary, but it involves the efforts of a diminutive, club-footed grandmother to rescue her grandson, a Tour de France cyclist, from the clutches of the French mafia. Aiding her are her faithful dog, Bruno, and the Triplets of the title, a trio of weird sisters who subsist on a diet of frogs and who make entrancing music with kitchen appliances and old newspapers. The Triplets is a similar collage of the found and the invented. Its style evokes a post-war France making its stubborn, eccentric way into the modern world — a nation of cigarette-rolling truck drivers and accordion-squeezing pop singers. It is surely the oddest movie of the year — by turns sweet and sinister, insouciant and grotesque, invitingly funny and forbiddingly dark. It may also, by dint of Mr. Chomet's sheer inventiveness, be one of the best. — A. O. Scott",1267,1

The  love Ms. Tom offers has little to do with tearful avowals and hearts and flowers  sentimentality and everything to do with following through, providing strong, thoughtful  care, and firm, but gentle discipline to her children, two of whom face early deaths. The  movie focuses on four young members of Ms. Tom's adopted family: Anthony, a forlorn  20-year-old (who looks about 11) and suffers from a degenerative skin disease that's  excruciatingly painful; Faith, a seven-year-old burn victim; Xenia, who has no legs; and  the house troublemaker, 15-year-old Joe, who suffers from cystic fibrosis and severe  attention deficit disorder.

Not manual labor or factory work, mind you, but the kind of corporate positions in finance, development, consulting and management that are hard to describe but that comfortably support millions of middle- and upper-middle-class families. Despite appearances, &quot;Time Out&quot; isn't a taut cat-and-mouse drama about a scheming white-collar criminal. This leisurely  film, threaded with exquisitely sad chamber music, is really an extended metaphysical meditation on the abstractions of the modern corporate workplace and the anomie of pushing papers and crunching numbers. – Stephen Holden",1308,1

When he returns years later, he is in charge of the Final Solution in Hungary. If &quot;Gloomy Sunday&quot; were better written and acted, it might have transcended its own pretensions and cast a clammy spell.

After the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, there were suddenly real estate problems because of the newly freed land under and around the former wall and into what used to be East Berlin. What is more important, the situation cried out for new buildings fashioned to unite the formerly divided city.  The film could easily have become a poisonous melodrama of builders and politicians fighting for power, looking to lay a claim to remake the Berlin area. But  &quot;Babylon&quot; mostly shows us the concentration of people assessing design problems, working out contracting and construction problems  and moving on to the next thing. As each building ascends, the gaping wound in the middle of Berlin begins to close. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",1340,1

"The mission of this film is essentially to garner sympathy for a white rapper involved in an old-school shootout — a rap contest. This may be the final frontier for pop, more unbelievable than the prospect of launching a member of 'N Sync into orbit. The film's star, Eminem, doesn't appear to have a great deal of range, but he can play himself. Even though the protagonist is named Rabbit, the thoughtful &quot;8 Mile&quot; is a raw version of the rapper's own success story.  This is basically an 80's go-for-it movie (the picture feels like some odd combination of &quot;Flashdance&quot; and &quot;Purple Rain&quot;), and Curtis Hanson has done a fine job of giving it a soul, though it's a gloomy, peeling-paint one.

The agile handling of the soap-opera elements makes  &quot;Wedding&quot; a pop, facile take on Capulet versus Montague stuff, likable but square. But like the monsoon rains that temper Delhi's summer heat, this movie offers subtle surprises. When it captures the small, hilarious skirmishes of a culture at war with itself and the families trying to hold their ground against change, it is enchanting. It also evokes  a marriage  of temperaments and subcultures — between  a Delhi family and a Bengali family —  subtly defining the differences between them. – Elvis Mitchell",1370,1

"Sitting through the romantic action-melodrama &quot;Beyond Borders,&quot; which follows a glamorous movie star couple as they tend to the needy in trouble spots like Ethiopia, Cambodia and Chechnya, is like watching someone trying to dry his hands with sandpaper. No amount of misguided effort is going to help. It's an easy picture to ridicule; after a while, you almost feel as if the stars are making fun of the movie. Or at least, you'll wish Angelina Jolie — with her radiant presence and Panavision lips — and Clive Owen, with his brisk, existentialist cool were smart enough to do so. After the &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot; movies, with their globe-trotting superficiality and numbing imbecility, Ms. Jolie must feel she owes her fans something serious. Unfortunately, she's starring in a movie even more benumbed and superficial, a liberal video game that demeans the very refugees it tries to spotlight. Her good-heartedness is probably the reason she chose to star in this film about a shallow young woman, Sarah Jordan, who's shaken out of her insular existence by the dashing Dr. Nick Callahan (Mr. Owen). &quot;Borders&quot; wants to dramatize the chasm between Sarah and Nick, whose impatient compassion endangers as many refugees as it saves. That metaphorical land mass is supposed to be her middle-class naiveté and his brooding, no-nonsense altruism. But they're much closer than they think — a pair of noble idiots. Inspired by his example, she raises money and follows him with medical supplies and food to Ethiopia. He repays her kindness with blithe cruelty. They finally tryst; the sweat beads seductively on their skins, while their glamorously gaunt jawlines expel plumes of cigarette smoke. This is a movie so oblivious that Martin Campbell, an accomplished action filmmaker, forgot that in the 1940's &quot;Casablanca&quot; had the good sense to have Rick note that the troubles of two people don't amount to a hill of beans. &quot;Borders&quot; is reminiscent of another 40's classic, the smashingly absurd &quot;Duel in the Sun,&quot; and is as realistic as a recent film based on real incidents: the remake of &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.&quot; — Elvis Mitchell",1372,1

In this standard variation of the princess myth, it takes a humbling fall from grace for  Molly to gain a smidgen of soul and a glimpse of happily ever after. Forced to work as a  nanny, she achieves a saccharine redemption with the help of her charge, a stern, orderly  8-year-old girl (Dakota Fanning), whom she in turn helps softed. While pretending to  teach a lesson in compassion, the movie wallows in the perks of privilege. — Stephen Holden",1385,1

"The actor Philip Seymour Hoffman tours America in the election year of 2000, looking into the health of our democratic system just as Robert Downey Jr. did in a project from the same producers, &quot;The Last Party,&quot; in 1992.  As in the first film, many complex issues are at stake, and Mr. Hoffman is good at listening intently, then nodding in furious agreement, as pundits like Noam Chomsky, Bill Maher and Michael Moore offer their assessments of the current state of democracy (the consensus:  things could be better).  But when the picture starts trotting out its celebrity spokespeople, &quot;The Party's Over&quot; becomes a contest between what it clearly designates as &quot;our stars&quot; &#151; Ben Harper, Eddie Vedder, Tim Robbins, Willie Nelson and others &#151;  and &quot;theirs&quot; (a sad line-up that peaks with Charlton Heston and a soundless shot of Arnold Schwarzenegger).  The film starts to seem less like a political documentary than a one-sided &quot;Battle of the Network Stars,&quot; with the younger generation clearly winning the charisma challenge. &#151; Dave Kehr",1394,1

"Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky, who begin filming the mighty heavy-metal band Metallica in early 2001, turn what might have been a conventional behind-the-scenes rockumentary into a riveting, intricate psychodrama. After nearly 20 years together, Metallica was in something of a funk, and they hired Phil Towle, a therapist, to help them through their artistic and interpersonal struggles. At its core, &quot;Some Kind of Monster&quot; is the portrait of a marriage: the angry, sustaining partnership between James Hetfield, the lead singer, and Lars Ulrich, the drummer, who founded the band as teenagers and must figure out how to keep it going now that they're in their 40's. &#151; A.

A group of prisoners at the Whitehead Correctional facility, including the good-natured Frances (LisaRaye) and the hard-boiled Nikki (N'Bushe Wright), do battle with a corrupt warden and the sadistic captain who dispenses vicious beatings and extorts sexual favors from the inmates. With the help of a shy, sensitive young corrections officer named Michael (Mos Def), they set out to find justice, which, after much bloodshed and a long, half-naked spell in solitary, they achieve with both bullets and lawsuits. &#151; A.

"This picturesque documentary is an exhilarating group portrait of four self-styled tramps and hobos who follow their bliss by illegally hopping freight trains that traverse some of the country's most beautiful terrain. One goal most have in common is to live as far outside the system as possible and not have to pay rent or work for a boss. Lee is a survivalist and anarchist  who lives in the woods and publishes a rail-riding zine. Switch and Baby Girl are a hippie  couple who must give up the lifestyle when they have a baby. Jessica is a restless college  dropout. Achieving such independence, of course, requires a high degree of self-sufficiency and tolerance for physical discomfort. The movie jumps track near the end  when it makes a cursory attempt to put the lifestyle into a broader historical context. &#151; Stephen Holden",1411,1

The premise of &quot;Intacto,&quot; Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's moody and intriguing metaphysical thriller, is that some people have the ability to steal luck from others. The movie follows the entwined destinies of a group of people endowed, and afflicted, by this gift. Luck, in this world, is a commodity to be stolen, hoarded or traded. But the acquisition of it, and the lust for more than one's share, has a corrupting, soul-destroying effect.  Mr. Fresnadillo, who wrote the screenplay with Andrés M. Koppel, teases out the implications of his film's Borgesian ideas with impressive elegance. &#151; A. O. Scott",1422,1

"This French melodrama is as dry as summer cornmeal. It's as if the director Anne Fontaine is trying to say that every nationality — and generation — needs its own austere and mechanical &quot;Ordinary People.&quot; It is just as grimly and pointedly plotted.&quot;Father&quot; opens with Jean-Luc (Charles Berling), a gerontologist, in conversation with one of his patients, an older man who's also a new father. Idly listening, he nods while hearing the patient's fear: that he'll be irrelevant by the time his son is grown. Soon, Jean-Luc will encounter another old man who's unnecessary: his own father. Viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some Freudian puppet.

The film is an entertaining statement of the obvious, though its big questions — do corporations serve our need or enslave our bodies and soul?, are public health problems caused by capitalist rapacity or personal choice? —  are not as simple as Mr. Spurlock would have us believe. — A.

"P. J. Hogan's adaptation of J. M. Barrie's novel is bracingly true to the tough, buoyant spirit of the original, and his filmmaking style is a perfect mixture of wide-eyed wonder and slightly melancholy sophistication. While Peter (Jeremy Sumpter) is appropriately dashing and adventurous, Hook (Jason Isaacs) wonderfully villainous and Tinker Bell (Ludivine Sagnier) as cute and naughty as anyone could wish, the movie belongs to Rachel Hurd-Wood's Wendy Darling. Ms. Hurd-Wood, a 13-year-old British actress making her professional debut, was born for the role, which calls on her to be a precocious child, an action heroine, the surrogate mother of a tribe of Lost Boys, and the romantic lead. Her soft, sensitive features display both Wendy's child-like eagerness and her incipient wisdom without overdoing either trait, and she and Mr. Sumpter remind us that Peter Pan, beyond all the swashbuckling and fantasy, is a love story, which ends on a poignant Jamesian note of renunciation. The sets and special effects are rousing and vivid, but what distinguishes this Peter Pan from the other versions (and from most recent children s entertainment) is its unsentimental insight into the terrors and delights of both childhood and growing up. — A. O. Scott",1450,1
"From a director for whom the quirky stylistic exercise is standard style, this is a handsome throwback to the salad days of its two iconic stars. Terence Stamp, in a stony, magnetic performance punctuated by flashbacks to his early career, plays an ex-con seeking revenge for the death of his daughter. He becomes the nemesis of Peter Fonda's slick Hollywood hipster, another role that's piquantly tailor-made.

But then the Blue Iguana isn't just any old West Coast fleshpot but a microcosm of this sad, lonely world and its lost female souls who cater to male lust. An ensemble piece developed from an improvisational workshop, the movie interweaves the stories of a half-dozen strippers and some of the men in their lives. More than anything, it is an acting showcase that allows its stars to strut their emotional range. - Stephen Holden",1469,1

"Over 17 years, in the midst of other, more ambitious projects, Jim Jarmusch assembled this anthology of minor-key vignettes in celebration of caffeine, nicotine and the indolent pleasure of sitting around and consuming them. Not that the people in the film are always having such a good time: they seem, rather, to get on one another's nerves with some regularity. Some of the chapters are almost vanishingly slight —  hipster anecdotes that float away like smoke rings. Others —  notably a hotel bar encounter in which Cate Blanchett plays both herself and a resentful cousin and a game of celebrity one-upmanship between Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan —  have the compact perfection of good one-act plays. The whole thing is like an old LP; some tracks are more memorable than others, but the cumulative effect is ragged, serendipitous magic. — A. O. Scott",1487,1

Michael Burke, the writer and director, details the humiliations of Mr. Hirsch's character with such detail and intensity that the film turns into something far removed from the sensitive study of emotional isolation that it was no doubt conceived to be — an unpleasant blend of cruelty and sentimentality. — Dave Kehr",1581,1

"This film adaptation of the J. K.

Years later Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) winds up in Hogwarts, an English boarding school for wizards. While shopping for his magic equipment, Harry comes across the Sorcerer's Stone, a bedeviled jewel whose power affects his first year at the enchanted school. The most highly awaited movie of the year has a dreary, literal-minded  competence, following the letter of the law as laid down by the book's author. The film comes across as a covers act by an extremely competent tribute band — not the real thing but an incredible simulation — and there's an audience for this sort of thing. But watching &quot;Harry Potter&quot; is like seeing &quot;Beatlemania&quot; staged in the Hollywood Bowl, where the cheers and screams will drown out whatever's unfolding onstage. – Elvis Mitchell",1584,1

But when Eva is displeased, she does more than administer a tongue-lashing.  &quot;Deliver Us From Eva,&quot; in which three men conspire to give this haughty diva her comeuppance, might be described as an amiable African-American variation of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew,&quot; translated into the concise, salty banter of a modern sitcom.

"The subject matter of the British director Shane Meadows's &quot;Midlands&quot; is a wry counterpoint to the film's sprawling, epic title. The movie is a soulful domestic comedy with more in common with the enchantingly freakish twitches of life found in a Bill Forsyth film like &quot;Local Hero&quot; than one of Sergio Leone's blood-orange epics like &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West.&quot;  &quot;Midlands&quot; weaves a large number of characters throughout the tract homes of Nottingham, where the movie is set. It threatens a showdown  between a pair of rivals, Dek (Rhys Ifans) and Jimmy (Robert Carlyle), who both want Shirley (Shirley Henderson). And by the end of the film, Mr. Meadows exaggerates the conventions of the western to make his own points about the foolishness of machismo.  But what really separates &quot;Midlands&quot; from Leone's desiccated, terse genre work is Mr. Meadows's doting attention over his characters' decency. It gives a demonstrative bittersweetness to a likable but small story. Jimmy strides into Shirley's life to reclaim her and their daughter, Marlene (Finn Atkins), though he's been out of the picture for so long that there could have been a reality show about his disappearance. It's an actual reality show that has caused the trouble for Dek; he proposed to Shirley, with whom he's been living and helping to raise her little girl, and she rebuffed him on national television. Stunned, he's picking up the shards of what used to be his dignity when Jimmy returns, further tangling the knot of emotional complications. &quot;Midlands&quot; is primarily a film about the need that fatherhood fills — Dek's closeness to Marlene registers strongly. — Elvis Mitchell",1689,1

Neither the filmmakers nor the actors can figure out whether to play this dubious premise as comedy or as earnest morality tale, and Mr. Garcia spends most of the picture looking stricken and self-pitying. He's so morose you can't imagine why anyone would pay him to provide pleasure, and most of the pleasure the movie affords comes from Mr. Jagger and Mr. Coburn, playing Byron's literary idol, who happens to be married to Byron's main client (Olivia Williams). In the end, what might have been — in the hands of, say, Albert Brooks — a piquant slice of absurdity turns into a sodden parable about a man who discovers what really matters and learns important lessons.

"Hou Hsiao-hsien's film has a much quicker pulse than several of his recent movies &#151; 1998's &quot;Flowers of Shanghai&quot; and 1996's &quot;Goodbye South, Goodbye&quot; &#151; and the blood racing through its temples come from the full-blooded pop and luminosity of the imagery in his melodrama. It's all buzz, instead of buzz-kill this time &#151; and superficially enjoyable, though not nearly as rich or resonant (or, for that matter, as memorable) as his other work. He's drawn toward stories of alienation and anguish, though they're generally rendered in unrelieved, hypnotic tableaus of stoicism punctuated by outbursts of anguish &#151; underscaled family tragedy with a hint of adrenaline. There's always a young person looking for an answer to a question better off unasked. Here, it's the sylph-like club hostess Vicki (Shu Qi), whose radiant smile and dimples are like all the lights in the room being fired up simultaneously. Vicki's spirits are being broken like an undernourished bull by a series of boyfriends, the DJ Hao-hao (Tuan Chun-Hao) and, later, the gangster Jack (Kao Jack) &#151; who does everything but play &quot;The Blueprint&quot; so it's clear exactly where he lives. That's only because rap isn't part of the musical purview of &quot;Mambo&quot;: the insistence of high-throb electronica calls out to Vicki, so that she pounds the thoughts out of her head. She runs to Jack, to whom she's attracted because of his nurturing side; for Vicki, he's a romantic version of mobster noblesse oblige. Mr. Hou makes an impressive case for the lure of drum and bass for Vicki &#151;  the music enlivens his reflexes, though he's not driven to make the emotional underpinning of the story as rich as he generally does. The soap opera stuff in &quot;Mambo&quot; isn't even as dense as the music.  Working with the screenwriter Chu Tien-Wen and the cinematographer Mark Lee Ping-Bing, the director has made a film that feels like an episode of  &quot;The O.C.&quot; directed by Wong Kar Wai: a pretty attractive concept, come to think of it. Some of the sequences &#151;  especially those contrasting her moribund life at home with Hao-hao versus getting her pupils dilated at the clubs &#151;  have a startling staying power.  Mr. Hou has a gift for vibrant shocks that roam around in an audience's head for years. When that singularly perverse capacity of his isn't connected to something more substantial, it seems a waste. Despite its artistry, &quot;Mambo&quot; seems to last nearly a millennium. &#151;  Elvis Mitchell",1714,1

The movie is a greatest-hits collection along the lines of a &quot;Beverly Hillbillies&quot; marathon on TV Land or Tim Conway's &quot;Dorf on Golf&quot; videos, where nostalgia and comedy are run through a food processor until they become a flavorless paste. -- Elvis Mitchell",1718,1

But if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of &quot;there but for the grace of God,&quot; it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world. — Stephen Holden",1722,1

Gigino's owner, Louis (Danny Aiello), despairs over the menu and grumbles because none of the chefs are Italian except the head chef, Udo (Edoardo Ballerini), who's his son. And Udo wants to take over the place.

"Todd Phillips's sparkling big-screen adaptation has a crafty, can-you-dig-it? spirit, derived from his affection for the mid-1970's cop show that inspired it and for the era itself. The original series featured a pair of apparently plainclothes cops — who were they supposed to be fooling? — played by Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul. Mr. Phillips may not quite be a filmmaker, but he's on his way to becoming a director; his grasp of tone is a few steps ahead of his previous film, &quot;Old School.&quot; Starsky (Ben Stiller) is probably one of those rare detectives who don't deserve the by-the-book speeches from their commanders. He is paired with another loner — cool, shaggy Hutch (Owen Wilson) — who's a step away from being bounced from the force. Starsky and Hutch are tethered to a harness of buddy-movie clichés, but their congeniality comes from the actors' chemistry, demonstrated in five previous films. Eschewing the confrontational machismo of the television series, the movie instead plays Starsky's zealous obliviousness against Hutch's low-rent worldliness. But the movie's advertising tagline, &quot;Starsky & Hutch — they're the Man,&quot; needs to be amended. The movie belongs, completely and utterly, to Snoop Dogg. Picking up the mantle of the police informant Huggy Bear, <em>he</em> is the man. — Elvis Mitchell",1795,1

"This swift, tangy drama, with a terrifically terse title, pits London's illegal immigrants against the alluring hope of propriety. They are a forgotten population struggling to bring in enough income so that they don't become disposable. They're expendable manpower in the war to man the desks, mops and bottom-drawer duties of the behind-the-scenes world of luxury hotels, where they're unnoticed by the public, and underpaid and overworked by their employers. This is an urban-legend horror story rendered with grim intelligence by the man with the right tools for the job: Stephen Frears. This understated and sure film is set in a world of survivors. One of them, the Nigerian Okwe (Chiwetel Ejiofor) — who drives a cab and also works as a hotel porter under the large thumb of the smooth operator night manager, Sneaky, a smooth operator (Sergi Lopez) — seems to be as haunted as he is obsessed. The film doesn't elaborate on the troubles that have sent Okwe so far from home; all we really know is that he has left a wife and a daughter behind, and part of his pain comes from pining for them. That lingering misery is what keeps him safely on the couch of his Turkish roommate, the virginal Senay (Audrey Tatou), refusing to act on the magnetism that keeps her gazing at him adoringly. He's capable of loyalty to the rest of his ad hoc family —  to Guo Yi (Benedict Wong), the mortuary attendant, and the dangerously close-to-cliché, lovable hooker (Sophie Okonedo). The actress's cleverness brings shading and warmth to an otherwise stereotyped part. &quot;Dirty Pretty Things&quot; suggests a demented sequel to Paul Mazursky's &quot;Moscow on the Hudson,&quot; a dog-eared fairy tale in which industry and hard work could deliver refugees from evil, or at least into the middle classes. In &quot;Things,&quot; diligence is not its own reward — the decent have to fight the treacherous undertow of their employers as well as the opportunistic immigration agents. — Elvis Mitchell",1799,1

This bleary, lyrical ode to the Chelsea Hotel, the famous New York hostelry on West 23rd Street that has housed many legendary writers, painters and musicians, wants to be the film equivalent of an Abstract Expressionist painting, a beat generation rant and a wrist-slashing jazz ballad rolled into one.  But if &quot;Chelsea Walls&quot; builds a mood of boozy poetic disorientation, a crucial ingredient is missing: the scent of genuine artistic genius. — Stephen Holden",1806,1

The overlapping stories revolve around two families, one white, the other black, who are being pressured to sell their property to greedy developers. Among more than a dozen characters who cross paths in the course of the story, the most compelling are Marly Temple (Edie Falco), a sardonic young woman who runs her family's motel, and Desiree Perry (Angela Bassett), a former teenage rebel who returns after a 25-year absence to confront her straitlaced mother (Mary Alice). More than a probing civics lesson, the movie takes the political and spiritual pulse of our restless national psyche. — Stephen Holden",1809,1

"This feature film version of the 1970's cop show preserves the most memorable thing about the old television series: Barry DeVorzon's wah-wah crackle theme song. Unfortunately Clark Johnson and a battery of writers have also retained the punitive monotony and barely coherent narrative thinness of the old show as well: it evokes the feeling of wasting a rainy Saturday afternoon. The foreign crime boss Alex Martel (Olivier Martinez) is about to be extradited after leaving a trail of corpses and misery. Following a failed jailbreak —  after which Martel inexplicably gets to speak to the television cameras —  he offers &quot;one hundred million dollars to whoever gets me out to here.&quot; And law and order in Los Angeles suddenly evaporates, with all of the city's thugs, gang-bangers and semi-employed, dangerous-looking actors marshalling their forces to spring Martel. An elite S.W.A.T. team has to transport this prisoner to either a federal pen, the airport or another film remake of an old Aaron Spelling television show. The S.W.A.T. team members —  LL Cool J, Michelle Rodriguez, Josh Charles and Brian Van Holt —  are so gung ho that in any other city they'd be subjected to steroid testing. Samuel L. Jackson plays the absurdly named team leader Hondo —  it comes from the old show —  with the Rhythm-Heritage confidence that burbles like the old-school funk of Mr. DeVorzon's theme. And Colin Farrell, employing a wobbly American accent that makes him sound like an international criminal a step ahead of the authorities, stars as the S.W.A.T. officer Jim Street. Much of the by-the-yard martial choreography is strictly by-the-book, as Hondo's martinet captain might say. Mr. Johnson almost seems to be rejecting the fascist politics of the premise, and his discomfort is palpable, like Danny Glover's slight hesitations in the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; movies. — Elvis Mitchell",1836,1

"Postponed several times since the Sept. 11 attacks, this would-be satire depicts an American military given over to loutishness, corruption and outright criminality. In the fall of 1989, as the Berlin Wall prepares to come down, the American forces stationed in West Germany occupy themselves with drug-dealing, arms trafficking and black marketeering. The hero, Ray Elwood (Joaquin Phoenix), is a smug, amoral supply specialist who is nonetheless the most sympathetic character in the movies, thanks to Mr. Phoenix's witty, breezy performance. Unfortunately, the director, Gregor Jordan, seems unable to organize the film's proliferating subplots with any efficiency or coherence, so it stumbles between mockery and romance, and ultimately bogs down in a violent, draggy caper story. If the movie were better, its cynical view of the United States military might be genuinely provocative (and to many, outrageous), but even for a film that revels in anarchy, it's too chaotic by half. — A.O.

In the end, this turns out to be another exercise in moral shock therapy, in which important themes about the responsibility of art and the corrupting effects of erotic power are pointed at without really being explored. The whole thing is empty and tedious, a preposterous, amateurish sketch of human motivation held up as though it were a window or a mirror. Provocative, perhaps, but not at all thought-provoking. That would have required some actual thought, rather than the rehearsal of puerile assumptions and easy, cynical attitudes. — A. O. Scott",1873,1

And the degree to which Massillon's self-esteem seems to depend on the team's performance is astonishing, even a little scary. For all its skepticism about the value of pouring so much emotion and so many  resources into high school football, &quot;Go Tigers!&quot; is never disrespectful. It leaves you liking and even admiring the people of Massillon for their spunk and their passionate commitment to carrying on a hallowed tradition. - Stephen Holden",1877,1

The effectiveness of their movies, which often featured grisly real-life sounds and images of the wounded and the dead, is open to debate, and the film offers some dry and predictable sociological interpretation. But the real fascination lies in the curious combination of civic-mindedness with ghoulish prurience, as Bret Wood profiles a group of plain-spoken Midwesterners who made crude, powerful horror movies in the name of social and moral improvement. — A.

"A softhearted tribute to — of all things — Communism, the German director Wolfgang Becker's social satire has a knobby tone that somewhat mutes its crowd-pleasing ambitions and keeps it from becoming &quot;My Big, Fat Life Is Beautiful.&quot; The film captures the struggle of the devoted Alex (Daniel Brühl), fighting to keep his mother's failing health up. In 1989, just before the fall of the German Democratic Republic, Christiane (Katrin Sass) sees her son beaten by police during a riot. She falls into a coma and the Berlin Wall — and all that implies — collapses during that time. &quot;Mother slept through the relentless triumph of capitalism,&quot; Alex notes. Any sudden shock could kill her, so Alex contrives to keep her convinced that things are still the same. Alex has to rescue the paste-board furniture that he and his sister were happy to heave onto a junk heap; the utilitarian design of the furniture seems to inform us that East Berlin may have been where Ikea got its ideas from. There are a few bright jokes and sharp observations in &quot;Lenin!&quot; Alex's determination eventually pulls in everyone he knows; instead of paying off East German officials for better supplies, he's now giving money to kids to dress as Young Pioneers — the East German equivalent of Boy Scouts — to serenade his mother. His boyhood idol — a cosmonaut who now occupies a reduced station in life — becomes part of the imposture. And his best friend and fellow satellite television installer recreates old-school newscasts. The laughs grow out of the elaborate lies they have to construct when Christiane inadvertently glimpses the new world. But the zing of the &quot;Lenin!&quot; highlights doesn't keep the movie breathless enough. Mr. Becker can generate tension when necessary — he doesn't get to flex that muscle enough. — Elvis Mitchell",1907,1
"A romantic fantasy for women and a horror movie for male viewers, &quot;Amy's Orgasm&quot; was written and directed by Julie Davis, who was also co-producer, co-editor and star. Ms. Davis's Amy is a single Los Angeles woman in her 20's who has written a best-selling self-help book, &quot;Why Love Doesn't Work,&quot; which teaches women they don't need a man to be complete. Of course, she cutely confesses in her voice-over narration, she is desperately lonely and hasn't had sex in years. This movie is Ms. Davis's fourth film as a director (her work includes the 2001 &quot;All Over the Guy&quot;), and she has a bright, chipper style that keeps things moving, while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race. Like someone who smiles too much, &quot;Amy's Orgasm&quot; seems rather sad at heart. — Dave Kehr",1908,1

Stranded at a bus station, Judith (Heather Matarazzo) and Jimmy (Mark Weston) spin tales about the people they see there and reveal things about each other through their extemporaneous fictions. Ms. Skyler gets standout performances, and her patience and skill are revealed in small, satisfying ways throughout the film. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",1922,1

"Just below the sitcom surface of this smart-talking comedy seethes a bitter critique of the sportive sexual habits of  Southern California's babes-and-hunks culture. Alice (Julianne Nicholson) and Ed (Jay Mohr), an attractive, comfortably monogamous couple about to be married, decide to play around as a premarital treat to themselves before settling down. Alice persuades her reluctant fiancé that having more notches in their respective belts will  fortify their union. Her body count of three encounters simply isn't enough. It all backfires, of course, in jealousy and competition. In real life, the emotions displayed by the characters are much messier and more volatile than the little spats and hissy fits that erupt. But if the movie glosses over uncomfortable realities like jealousy, at least it touches on them. But what does it tell us that the movie's moral grounding wire, Ed's friend, Carl (Andy Richter), is the one younger character who doesn't qualify as a hottie? Plain guys can't play? &#151; Stephen Holden",1926,1

In Mr. Gonick's defiantly incoherent script, Winnipeg is about to be swept away by a flood of biblical proportions. To precipitate this seemingly welcome event, an enterprising disc jockey, D.J. Sabu (Jeremie Yuen), who normally provides the sounds for a sort of traveling outdoor pornography fair, decides to stage a rave party at the peak of Winnipeg's only notable geographical feature, a heap of landfill known as Garbage Hill. – Dave Kehr",1933,1

Like Alexander Mackendrick's &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; (1957), &quot;Ace&quot; has a lively and frightening yellow-journalism motif. Kirk Douglas stars as Charles Tatum, a cynical, opportunistic reporter who seizes on the story of his career: a man is trapped in a mine. Tatum not only covers the event but also begins to steer the story, slowing down the rescue attempt so that the story can get even bigger play. &quot;Ace in the Hole&quot; is an acquired taste — and an unforgettable one. — Elvis Mitchell",1953,1

Napoleon, hides a sentimental, melodramatic heart beneath its grimy, naturalistic surface. The film might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted. The characters would resonate more if there were fewer of them, and if they were not pushed through so many contrived dramatic incidents. — A. O. Scott",1956,1

"Isabel Walker (Kate Hudson) arrives in Paris just as her half-sister (Naomi Watts) undergoes the marital catastrophe the gives this sluggish, misshapen comedy of manners its title. Adapted from Diane Johnson's brisk, knowing novel, the film somehow manages to squander both a first-rate ensemble cast and a rich, durable source of comedy: the social and romantic misadventures of Americans in France. Isabel's character and motives remain irritatingly blank, even as she undergoes a wondrous transformation, acquiring a taste for fine lingerie, elegant coiffure and suave, middle-aged politicians. But the movie lets the accessories do too much of the work, and only Thierry Lhermitte (as Isabel's politician lover) and Glenn Close (as an expatriate writer) show any real comic esprit; it's a comedy made by filmmakers with little sense of timing and almost no sense of humor, with plenty of good taste and no real flavor. — A.O.

"Patrice Chereau's film, following the sexual intensity of &quot;Intimacy,&quot; brings a similarly harsh naturalism to the subject of illness. The story is radically simple: Luc (Eric Caravaca), a gay schoolteacher living in Paris, cares for his estranged brother, Thomas (Bruno Todeschini), who suffers from a debilitating and possibly fatal blood disease. The film is both tender and abrasive, never flinching from the brute physical horror of illness, and therefore refusing any of the moralism or sentimentality that so often afflicts movie treatments of disease. It is not always pleasant to sit through, but it has the raw, unsettling power, and the surprising tenderness, of a Lucian Freud painting brought to life. &#151; A. O. Scott",2101,1

"In her personal  documentary film, Pearl Gluck has made what may the first movie to evoke in equal  measure the attraction of the highly circumscribed, ritualized world of Hasidic Judaisim  and the equally compelling reasons she abandoned it. The movie is a flighty push-pull affair, in which a so-called &quot;chorus&quot; of voices of ex-Hasidic Jews comments on Ms. Gluck's campaign to maintain her connection with her devout father, even after she has  &quot;slipped&quot; (to use her word). The movie is an attempt to win him back, on her terms. After attending college, she received a Fulbright scholarship to visit the home of her ancestors  in Hungary and Ukraine. The diaristic movie follows her on this journey, during which she hopes to retrieve a legendary couch, associated with miracles and magic, which many rabbis slept on, and bring it to the United States as a kind of offering. &#151; Stephen Holden",2115,1

There are two groups probably sharing the same dread about this film adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's ornate and busy work: its most loving adherents and those who have spent their lives avoiding the books. But neither side is likely to be disappointed by Peter Jackson's altogether heroic job in tackling perhaps the most intimidating nerd/academic fantasy classic ever. – Elvis Mitchell",2118,1

"Here's a real UFO, an extremely low-budget, genuinely independent film by a 22-year-old writer-director from Philadelphia that immediately establishes a distinctive and promising voice. Andrew Repasky McElhinney's &quot;Chronicle of Corpses&quot; is a gothic horror tale set in the early 19th century on the grounds of a dying slave plantation somewhere in the Middle Atlantic states. Though once the center of a thriving economy, the plantation has degenerated into inertia and neglect, largely as a result of the deepening decadence of its ruling family.  Shooting on 16-millimeter film and using a cast drawn largely from local theater groups, Mr. McElhinney has created a movie that is not without the flaws endemic in low-budget productions but still projects an amazing degree of stylistic assurance and originality. - Dave Kehr",2126,1

"Only now being given a release in the United States, Masato Harada's 1997 film enters the seamy world of Japanese high school girls who work part time as prostitutes.  It's a classic exploitation film, combining titillation (involving some very young-looking actresses in some very rough- looking situations), sentimentality (the girls bond together, looking out for the most innocent among them), and social commentary (our consumer culture is ultimately at fault, for getting these young women hooked on brand-name clothes they can't really afford).  Mr. Harada offers a full &quot;Mondo Cane&quot;-style catalog of the sexual kinks of Japanese men; the most perverse among them, who would rather watch the girls clean urinals than have sex with them, is pointedly identified as a government minister.  But in the end &quot;Bounce Ko Girls&quot; (the title is apparently a corruption of a Japanese phrase meaning &quot;bouncing high school girls&quot;) becomes a female bonding movie of the old school, as the three young women pitch in to get each other out of their respective scrapes. &#151; Dave Kehr",2146,1

"The scaly spire of the Chrysler Building in New York City is the summit of all dreams in &quot;Cremaster 3,&quot; the centerpiece of Matthew Barney's deliriously esoteric five-part epic cycle exploring artistic creation and destruction. With its spiky Art Deco crown, that skyscraper is a potent symbol of demonically ambitious creativity in a film that celebrates the twin urges to build and destroy as inseparable (and irrational) compulsions. At its most powerful, the largely wordless film evokes this theme with thrilling rushes of imagery, music and visual humor. &quot;Cremaster 3&quot; is the largest and final piece in a cycle that was filmed out of order (4, 1, 5, 2, 3) beginning in 1994 and that has already been canonized as a major work of contemporary fine art. — Stephen Holden",2152,1

"That old saying &quot;the personal is political&quot; certainly applies to the Korean-American comedian Margaret Cho, whose brilliant, over-the-edge concert film carries candid sexual humor into previously uncharted territory. It is a paradoxical film whose abundant sexual profanity is slung with a conversational casualness that divests it of anger and shock value. Like it or not, that's  the way we think and talk in a sexually sophisticated society. But as  graphically as Ms. Cho describes kinky sexual experiments, she is not interested in shock for shock's sake or even in titillation. The movie, directed and edited by Lorene Machado and taped in Seattle before a largely gay and lesbian audience, is really about personal liberation. She relishes the extent to which sex, despite its promise of ecstasy and  potential for humiliation, is also a cosmic joke. &#151; Stephen Holden",2163,1

In time, Nameless spins a second, a third and finally a fourth version, changes in perspective that Mr. Zhang signals with shifts of color that flood the screen with a red as vivid as that of a Little Red Book, a spotless white, a delicate blue and a pale pistachio so mouthwatering you may want to lick the screen.

The plot is so relentlessly linear that you may figure everything out long before McCaleb does, and Mr. Eastwood directs with all the flair and style of a television cop-show hack. But the actor, who is 72, has embraced his codgerhood with wry humor, and his old-fashioned, by-the-book approach to filmmaking offers some satisfactions that younger, flashier thriller-mongers don't bother to attempt. — A.

But from the time they are little girls, Marina (Anna Friel) and her best friend and next-door neighbor, Holly (Michelle Williams), find themselves locked in a power struggle that only Marina is fully aware of for much of that time. Under its drab contemporary trappings, the movie is really a Jane Austen-like moral parable in which goodness is rewarded and selfishness punished. &#151; Stephen Holden",2216,1

"With this thought-provoking documentary, the director and cinematographer Hart Perry returns to some 16mm film he shot in 1979 while he was working for the Texas Farm Workers Union.   The resurrected material concerns a strike that broke out in the southern Texas community of Raymondville, when local union pickers  most if not all of them Mexican-Americans  decided that 25 cents a bushel, the going rate for their labor for over twenty years  was no longer enough to live on.  Returning some twenty years later, Mr. Perry finds a more open community, one in which Latinos are beginning to have a say in their government, but also a devastated economy, left behind by farmers who preferred to close up rather than employ the no longer docile local workers.  Dense, contradictory and distressingly honest, Valley of Tears is that rarity among political documentaries:  a genuinely thought-provoking film. — Dave Kehr",2224,1

"One of the smartest films for older children in quite some time, Tommy O'Haver's &quot;Ella Enchanted&quot; is a funny (and at times, politically pointed) take-off on the ancient conventions of fairy tales. Anne Hathaway, the vivacious young star of &quot;The Princess Diaries,&quot; plays the title character, a put-upon teenager in a storybook world whose widowed father (Patrick Bergin) has injudiciously married Dame Olga (Joanna Lumley, of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;), the mother of all wicked stepmothers.  She comes complete with a pair of entertainingly hateful daughters (Lucy Punch and Jennifer Higham), who like nothing better than torturing Ella — particularly once they discover that, thanks to a questionable gift bestowed by a fairy (Vivica A. Fox), she is unable to refuse any order she is given.  As Ella sets out to find the errant fairy and convince her to revoke her dubious present, the screenwriters Laurie Craig, Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith (working from a novel by Gail Carson Levine) take her through various effects-filled realms, including a land where elves are forced by the evil regent to sing, dance and be relentlessly merry, and a forced labor compound for giants that looks disturbingly like a concentration camp.  Mr. O'Haver gives the political subtext a forceful treatment but does not pat himself on the back for it; the messages blend seamlessly into the fantasy and comedy. — Dave Kehr",2250,1

"&quot;The Jungle Book,&quot; released in 1967, was the last of the animated features bearing his name to which Walt Disney made a substantial contribution. It's a safe bet that Disney would have shuddered to see his name attached to &quot;The Jungle Book 2,&quot; a sequel created by the Disney studio's Australian-based direct-to-video arm, DisneyToon Studios. The new film does little but recycle the memorable moments of the first — including the song &quot;Bare Necessities,&quot; now a staple of Disney anthologies — while rendering them in a cheap, thin style of animation far closer to Saturday morning television than to the classic Disney features. — Dave Kehr",2276,1

"This film version of the old television series teams up Eddie Murphy and Owen Wilson in the Bill Cosby and Robert Culp roles. The slim plot and its predictable third-act twist involve the theft of the Switchblade, the newest example of United States Stealth plane technology, by evildoers. That's the word used by the spy boss, McIntyre (Bill Mondy), who assigns the bumbling special agent Alexander Scott (Mr. Wilson) to retrieve the stolen plane from the evildoer Gundars (Malcolm McDowell). Scott is hooked up with the megalomaniacal boxing champ Kelly Robinson (Mr. Murphy). It's a novel notion, trying to shoehorn two actors who are born scene-stealers into a buddy comedy. But in this case, there are far more laughs in the idea of Mr. Murphy and Mr. Wilson fighting to upstage each other than there are in the movie. — Elvis Mitchell",2279,1

It is also a computer- and video-age tribute to Michelangelo Antonioni's 1966 film ''Blow Up'' that explores the limitations of truth as revealed through pictures. Bill Pullman is bracingly feisty as a producer of action-adventure films whose macho brio is shattered after he is carjacked and nearly killed, and he goes into hiding. Andie MacDowell is his neglected wife who seizes his empire after his disappearance. Gabriel Byrne is the ambivalent mastermind behind an elaborate surveillance system that the Government is secretly testing in Los Angeles. While monitoring that system, he is witness to a crime he doesn't understand. Ry Cooder composed the gorgeous, shivering musical score. &#151; Stephen Holden",2342,1

The film's central figure is Jean, a young bohemian engagingly played by a not yet famous Jean-Michel Basquiat. The fictional character's life bears a powerful resemblance to Basquiat's own at the time: he is a struggling musician and graffiti artist living on the Lower East Side, trying to patch a life together from cadged meals and drink tickets and the occasional sale of a painting. - Dave Kehr",2359,1

"This brassy cross-dressing farce shows that Hollywood still gets the jitters when it comes to gender-bending. But its contradictions are subsumed under a high concept: &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; meets &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot; in the land of &quot;As You Like It,&quot; with Shakespeare's Forest of Arden turned into a West  Hollywood drag club. Here Connie (Nia  Vardalos) and Carla (Toni Collette), two  bedraggled female veterans of the dinner-theater circuit on the run from mobsters, become  overnight (and highly unlikely) cult stars by posing as gay drag performers singing  Broadway standards. The movie knows and doesn't care that it has only the most tenuous connection to the real world. As drag performers, Ms. Collette (who at times resembles John Epperson as Lypsinka) is far more adroit at caricature than Ms. Vardalos, whose alter-ego suggests a homier, drag version of Kathy Najimy with a smirk that evokes traces of Mary Martin and Phyllis Diller.

Kal Penn is the family friend's son, Hari's thoroughly Americanized opposite number.  In between jokes about body odor and Bollywood musicals, they learn to love and respect each other.

"Tom Hanks plays Viktor Navorski, a traveler from a fictitious Eastern European country who spends a year stranded in the International Arrivals Terminal at Kennedy Airport. What sounds like a nightmare turns out to be a soothing comic dream, thanks to Steven Spielberg's playful virtuosity, and also to the talents of the cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, who infuses the neutral, unwelcoming architecture of the airport with soft, radiant light. The story is a bit soft: Viktor is befriended by a motley group of airport workers, bedeviled by a Homeland Security apparatchik (Stanley Tucci) and beguiled by an unhappy flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones). There is a bit too much easy sentiment and artificial sweetness, and Ms. Zeta-Jones's character is woefully underwritten. But these flaws cannot dispel the film's deep enchantment. Mr. Hanks, like Mr. Spielberg, has nothing left to prove, and the nuances lurking in his sly, genial performance emerge only in retrospect. Similarly, the movie's deepest engagement with some of the central anxieties of modern life can be found not in its plot but in its ambience. It is a visual tour de force that turns fear into optimism, loneliness into solidarity, and frustration into resourcefulness. — A. O. Scott",2453,1

The material comes packed with dramatic possibilities and rich metaphors, but Mr. Roy focuses most of his energy on caricaturing his wealthy former friends.  You would probably have to go back to the Soviet propaganda of the 1920's to find more a vicious treatment of the British aristocracy, who are here portrayed as cocaine-sniffing, wife-swapping, servant-beating decadents, for whom snobbery is more than a way of life &#151; it's a religion. Like Mike Figgis's &quot;Timecode,&quot; the film is presented in a split screen format, a device that seems both distracting and dishonest, since the soundtrack, switching from channel to channel, is used to guide the spectator's attention just as firmly as traditional editing techniques. &#151; Dave Kehr",2461,1

"The concentration of synthetic hormones pumping through the vascular system of &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot; matches any recent action-adventure movie in the sheer density of steroids per liter of body fluid. In bodybuilding terms, this overmuscled sequel to &quot;Pitch Black&quot; is all bulk and no definition. In touch with the grunting, preening culture of professional wrestling, the negligible screenplay by David Twohy, who directed  both movies, is crammed with trailer-ready taglines. Intoned by Vin Diesel with a sly comic gravity, these enigmatic blurbs mean next to nothing. Returning from &quot;Pitch  Black,&quot; Mr. Diesel's character, Riddick, a fugitive from a distant planet, pursued across the universe by bounty hunters, might be described as the heavy-metal version of Brad Pitt's Achilles in &quot;Troy.&quot; Here he runs afoul of the Necromongers, an evil race of conquerors. The movie is all about nonstop action, computer generated spectacle and sanitized sadomasochism, edited into one big roaring whir. — Stephen Holden",2471,1

"Christopher Herrmann's independent feature represents something new under the sun:  sincere camp.  The picture is at once a heartfelt tribute to the legendary dancer and choreographer Martha Graham, and also a campy send-up of her myth.  Graham, a tiny person in real life (she died in 1991 at 96), is played in &quot;Ghostlight&quot; by Richard Move, a conspicuously male performance artist who appears to be well over six feet tall.  Written by Mr. Hampton and Penny Fearon, the script imagines an ageless Graham still alive in contemporary New York City, where she is desperately searching for the money to mount her latest modern ballet, an interpretation of the Phaedra myth.  As Martha tromps around the city, looking for financial and institutional support, she's followed by a camera crew led by documentary filmmaker Barbara Rosen (Ann Magnuson), whose voice over-narration fills in much of the necessary background. Ms. Magnuson's consummate professionalism offers an unflattering contrast to Mr. Move's not-so-inspired amateurism.  Where Ms. Magnuson's performance is based on careful modulations of her silky voice, Mr. Move spends most of the movie hissing through clenched teeth, in a falsetto that unfortunately but inescapably suggests Frank Oz's Miss Piggy. &#151; Dave Kehr",2477,1

Now, back in Toronto, she has made &quot;Bollywood/Hollywood,&quot; a disappointingly shallow and not terribly funny romantic comedy that seems to be making yet another bid for the public that packed its way into &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding.&quot;  The script &#151; about a dot.com millionaire (Rahul Khanna) who hires an escort girl (Lisa Ray) to impersonate his fiancée at his sister's upcoming wedding &#151; wants to be self-conscious in its frequent use of cliché and coincidence, inviting comparison both to the contrived romantic comedies of Hollywood and Bollywood's grandly artificial musicals (hence, the title). But the dialogue and situations have little in the way of genuine wit, and the pseudo-Bollywood production numbers that punctuate the action (often with explanatory subtitles, such as &quot;Romantic Couple Song&quot;) are never as extravagant or entertaining as the real thing. &#151; Dave Kehr",2501,1

A couple of years ago, Mr. McTiernan devised a retooled version of Jewison's &quot;Thomas Crown Affair&quot; and now, he has produced an Extreme Sports version of Jewison's glum sci-fi anticapitalist fantasy film.  In this third-rate action film, Chris Klein plays a hotshot young athlete who is lured into Central Asia to play professional Rollerball, a sport combining polo, MotoCross and felony assault. Mr. Klein learns that life is cheap – the team owner (Jean Reno) exercises a no-trade clause in the most brutal way possible. Coming on the heels of the failed XFL, &quot;Rollerball&quot; is about as relevant as an expose on the inner workings of Roller Derby. As Mr. Klein's teammates, there's a relaxed LL Cool J and a surprisingly adept Rebecca Romjin Stamos, who can't quite keep her accent in check. – Elvis Mitchell",2507,1

"This candy-hued camp comedy presents the latest variation of the playwright and drag performer Charles Busch's long-running and very funny alter ego, a swiveling red-headed diva whose exaggerated graciousness and noblesse oblige embody the ne plus ultra of Great Hollywood Ladies. Mr. Busch's character, Angela Arden, is a semi-retired pop singer, once known as &quot;America's Nightingale,&quot; who suggests a hybrid of Joan Crawford, Barbara Stanwyck and Joan Fontaine. The absurdist  movie, which is all plot and no plot at the same time, is a broad spoof of so-called  women's pictures from the 1940's through the 60's. Elements of &quot;Whatever Happened to  Baby Jane?,&quot; &quot;Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte,&quot; &quot;Valley of the Dolls,&quot; &quot;Sunset Boulevard,&quot; &quot;Portrait in Black&quot; and even &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; are swirled together along with vintage  good-twin, bad-twin Hollywood melodramas.

"This suds-filled political melodrama, which bashes the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico with a contempt that verges on hysteria, could be accused of many things, but timidity is not one of them. The film tells the story of Father Amaro (Gael García Bernal), a dreamy-eyed 24-year-old cleric dispatched to a small parish church in Los Reyes to assist its aging priest, Father Benito (Sancho Gracia). What Father Amaro discovers is a corrupt church bureaucracy collaborating with local drug lords who donate huge sums of money to favorite church charities. In return the church hierarchy turns a blind eye to their activities. The scandalous nature of the movie has helped make it the highest-grossing home-grown film in Mexican history. Terrible things happen in &quot;El Crimen del Padre Amaro,&quot; but the movie ultimately has no tragic dimension. — Stephen Holden",2564,1

Her new film is a gesture of profound gratitude toward the couple and other heroic families who rescued children in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Poland.

This seductive Italian film uses the image of beautiful strangers secretly and obsessively studying each other through opposite windows, to reflect on two related romantic syndromes, the &quot;grass is always greener&quot; and the &quot;absence makes the heart grow fonder&quot; quandaries. Instead of encasing the characters in a Hitchcockian murder mystery, the film compares the fantasies of possible lovers (Giovanna Messogiorno and Raoul Bova) to the romantic, six-decade-old memories of a mysterious octogenerian (Massimo Girotti), whose story gradually comes to focus. The movie swept the Italian equivalent of the Oscars in 2003. — Stephen Holden",2635,1

All this addled sincerity comes from trying to create wonderment for adults, growing out of a morose astronaut's rediscovery of his humanity on Mars. Gary Sinise plays the depressed astronaut, and his thoughtful patience makes him appear to be a little sluggish, though not as sluggish as the movie: narratively it seems to be taking place in zero gravity, where each minute seems to last an additional 30 seconds.

"Packed with extensive and expensive digital effects, &quot;Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed&quot; appears to represent Warner Brothers' effort to produce a home-grown rival to the studio's wildly successful &quot;Harry Potter&quot; franchise.  Adapted (like the first film, released in 2002) from a short-lived (1969-1972) Saturday morning cartoon series produced by the Hanna-Barbera factory, &quot;Scooby-Doo 2&quot; features a gang of all-American teens. They include handsome Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr.), perky Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar), brainy Velma (Linda Cardellini) and spacey Shaggy (Matthew Lillard), whose mascot is the semi-talking, computer-generated dog Scooby. The group battles the seemingly supernatural apparitions that beset the back-lot town of Coolsville.  Like the first film, &quot;Scooby Doo 2&quot; was directed by Raja Gosnell, a protégée of and former film editor for Chris Columbus, the maker of the first two &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films.  Mr. Gosnell does his best to recreate the Potter blend of mild spookiness and kiddie comedy, but the material just isn't as psychologically rich as J. K. Rowling's shrewd combination of adolescent self-pity and violent revenge fantasy. &#151; Dave Kehr",2690,1

"It takes a movie like &quot;The Grey Zone,&quot; a harrowing Holocaust drama based on true events, to bring home the limits of screen realism. The film, set almost entirely in the Auschwitz death camp in the autumn of 1944, tells the story of the 12th Sonderkommando, the next-to-last of the camp's 13 special squads of Jewish prisoners, who in exchange for helping the Nazis exterminate fellow Jews were given special privileges along with several more months of life before themselves being dispatched. The film was adapted for the screen by Tim Blake Nelson from his play. In turning the play into a film, the fateful decision was made to pursue a grim, uncompromising realism that may be unprecedented for a nondocumentary film about the Holocaust. These images are so strong that they defeat the film's moral complexity. — Stephen Holden",2697,1

The visions of Cassie, played by Melissa Sagemiller, a Gwyneth Paltrow look-alike, revolve chiefly around her boyfriend and true love, Sean (Casey Affleck), who supposedly died in a terrible auto accident right after Cassie and her pal Annabel (Eliza Dushku) arrived on the campus of Middleton College.  Yes, there is an explanation for everything, but it is a long time coming and not worth the wait. - Lawrence Van Gelder",2732,1
"In this epic of war and a lesson in tolerance, John Woo is meticulous in melding his own intimate style into the clichés of a large-scale war movie, paying homage to all the tired conventions of the genre; it's an honor these clichés don't deserve.  Driving the plot is the tension between Sergeant Enders (Nicholas Cage) and Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach), a young marine who is being trained along with other Navajos during World War II to transmit information from the battle front, because their native language is a code that cannot be broken by the Japanese. The picture invents an angle — kill the Navajos if they're captured, a battle condition of which there's no known record — and ignores the more compelling truth: that the Navajos are prevented from being active participants in the same war in which Native Americans raised the flag at Iwo Jima. — Elvis Mitchell",2733,1

"The directorial debut of John Malkovich is not the hammy manifesto you'd expect from the silent-film director the actor played in &quot;Shadow of the Vampire.&quot; Or, for that matter, the tantrummy, preening brat of &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; and &quot;Adaptation.&quot; &quot;Dancer&quot; — adapted for the screen by Nicholas Shakespeare, from his own novel — is a stoic tease of a movie. Mr. Malkovich proves his devotion to actors, lingering on them during moments of silence. And the movie echoes its director's own deportment as an actor, alternating silky smoothness with burlap coarseness. The lawyer-turned-police-officer Agustin Rejas (Javier Bardem) is tracking down a pack of guerrillas, led by the man known as Ezequiel. Ezequiel's career traces the same steps as Abimael Guzman, the philosophy professor turned leader of Peru's murderous Shining Path terrorist collective, right down to his capture. Determined, solicitous and calm, Rejas goes about his job, sifting through the wreckage — physical and emotional — left in Ezequiel's wake. Mr. Bardem plays Rejas with a morose wit, a cheekiness that registers almost as an afterthought. He exudes a weary professionalism because his manner is the only tool that keeps him from being subsumed by depression. Mr. Bardem's performance is different from anything he's done before — the vivacious Reinaldo Arenas of &quot;Before Night Falls,&quot; the brooding paraplegic of &quot;Live Flesh&quot; — characters who couldn't hide the tremors of emotion that rocked them to the very core. The balance of propriety suggests the ritual distance, and emotional intelligence, of Graham Greene — characters simply going through their doomed motions. — Elvis Mitchell",2738,1

Ms. Huppert's character, Sylvia, is an abused streetwalker in Nice whose life takes a desperate turn when her daughter, Laurence (Maud Forget), impulsively stabs to death a pimp who has been beating Sylvia. The two flee Nice for the north where Sylvia once led a  bucolic married life. The farther they go, the gooier it gets. &#151; Stephen Holden",2747,1

"First released in Hong Kong in 1993, &quot;Iron Monkey&quot; is an accomplished Chinese-language martial-arts adventure that has been given a light makeover by Miramax and tossed into mainstream theaters. The reason the film has suddenly become a commercial proposition is named Yuen Wo Ping. He is the director of &quot;Iron Monkey,&quot; as well as a couple of dozen other Hong Kong features, but he is probably best known to American audiences as the fight choreographer of &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.&quot; &quot;Iron Monkey&quot; isn't as extreme in its stylization as Mr. Yuen's more recent work. But it does feature several dazzling numbers built around the technique known as wire-work, in which performers are rigged up in elaborate trusses and pulled up and down like living marionettes. &#151; Dave Kehr",2750,1

The ugly nugget at the center of the story is that Heidi wasn't an orphan; her Vietnamese mother, Mai Thi Kim, was one among many coerced into giving up their children. &quot;Daughter&quot; may not be a great piece of filmmaking, but its power comes from its soul's-eye view of how well-meaning patronizing masked a social injustice, at least as represented by this case. — Elvis Mitchell",2824,1

It becomes a race against time when the husband retaliates by hiring Joe's buffoonish office  rival (Vincent Pastore) to foil their scheme. Mr. Perry's blustery, charmless performance  reaches a nadir when his character, posing as a veterinarian, must give a prostate massage  to an impotent bull named Tornado. — Stephen Holden",2852,1
"Rachael Leigh Cook plays Josie, whose band, the Pussycats, is so far down that even the group's managers ridicule it. But the Pussycats are hurled into stardom when a record executive (Alan Cumming) signs them to his label and remakes them. It turns out that Josie and company are pawns in a government conspiracy to use pop music to brainwash kids. &quot;Josie&quot; takes off from both the Archie Comics character and the cartoon series in which the band ran around solving mysteries. But the film is gruelingly self-referential, substituting sarcasm for irony. No one got around to telling the filmmakers that when a picture laughs at itself, it relieves the audience of the necessity of having to do so. — Elvis Mitchell",2853,1

"This is perhaps the silliest movie ever to certify the arrival of a major star since, well, &quot;The Fast and the Furious,&quot; the last collaboration between Rob Cohen and Vin Diesel. Mr. Diesel plays Xander Cage, an anarchist performance artist and skateboarder pressed into government service by a man named Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson), a National Security Agency potentate who plucks this renegade violence specialist from his velocity-freak life. Xander is sent off to Prague to stop the villain Yorgi (Marton Csokas) from his plan to unleash a biological weapon known as Silent Night on the world. &quot;XXX&quot; dances with the idea of supplanting espionage pictures but finally cranks up a bunch of chases. This is something the Bond films had the good taste — a phrase I never thought I'd use in discussing a Bond movie — to not employ exclusively in lieu of drama. — Elvis Mitchell",2855,1

"Michael Sergio's urban melodrama suggests the contemporary equivalent of any number of 1930's B movies in which an ex-convict who has cleaned up his act strides manfully through his old neighborhood to face down its roiling dangers and temptations. Here, that neighborhood is Astoria, Queens. Mr. Sergio's shrill screenplay is an ungainly mechanical contraption in which every swatch of dialogue rings with the clank of clichéd oratory. With a ponderous self-consciousness, the story builds to a saloon shootout that parodies a standard western showdown. The performances are correspondingly overblown and the soundtrack inundated with grandiose choral music and mediocre hard rock. &#151; Stephen Holden",2859,1

"This feel-good romantic comedy pits the proud, chaste widow of a New Bedford  fisherman (Sofia Milos) against a penniless English card shark (Jason Isaacs) who falls in love when he  hears her sing Portuguese fado songs in a local restaurant, and seduces her with lies. The  movie wants to portray the formidable widow and the toxic twit as an appealing odd  couple (something like Hugh Grant and the young Anna Magnani) who click, but Mr. Isaacs's gambler is such a louse that no amount of contrition can earn him sympathy &#151; Stephen Holden",2871,1
"This misty, smoky, plodding epic claims to resurrect the &quot;true story&quot; that has been buried in centuries of Arthurian legend. Arthur (Clive Owen) is a mopey Roman officer, whose knights are a band of conscripts policing the area around Hadrian's Wall and fighitng off the Woads, a band of guerrilla fighters led by Merlin. The Romans withdraw, the Saxons arrive (led by Stellan Skarsgaard, hamming it up in braids) and Arthur grapples with his identity crisis and falls in love with Guinevere (Keira Knightley), a tough Woad babe he has rescued from a Roman dungeon. The battle scenes have some impact, though not much coherence, but the director Antoine Fuqua gives the movie an element of brawny, B-picture camp that mitigates its ponderous dullness. — A. O.

"Anne Reid's character, May, is a recently widowed grandmother who pursues an affair with her daughter's hunky, unhappily married  boyfriend (Mr. Craig). The sight of a dilapidated woman besotted with a careless young  god in his 30's may be uncomfortably taboo busting. But the extraordinarily clear-sighted  and psychologically balanced British drama stares as calmly at May's perilous leap into churning emotional rapids as a medical show does when keeping its gaze fixed on a tricky surgical procedure. The bravery of Ms. Reid's screen performance can be measured by her utter  lack of self-consciousness when naked before the camera. When desire trumps May's  maternal feelings, and she knowingly (and guiltily) risks exile from her family to pursue  a hopeless infatuation, she is achingly believable. Hanif Kureishi's screenplay is infused  with an unwavering Chekhovian compassion. Neither good nor evil, its characters are  complicated, ordinary people coping as best they can with their emotional wounds and  their fear of the future, grabbing at illusions of salvation and whatever zest they can drag  into their lives, even while suspecting that the most passion can provide is a temporary  quick fix. — Stephen Holden",2885,1

"This family-friendly movie about two tiger cubs, Kumal and Sangha, growing up the jungle somewhere in French Indochina in the 1920's, is terribly hokey. But once you accept the anthropomorphic premise that a gentle pussycat lurks inside of the most ferocious tiger, the movie succeeds as an inspirational pastorale and passionate moral brief for animal rights and preservation. It also inveighs unequivocally against one culture's looting of another's historical treasures. The movie isn't as gripping as the director's much-loved 1988 film, &quot;The Bear.&quot; But when it concentrates on its animal stars (each played by several tigers), it remains on solid ground. Guy Pearce is a treasure-seeking marauder and big game hunter who softens and considers abandoning his rapacious ways. &#151; Stephen Holden",2914,1

The director, Marc Levin, is establishing images of two cultures on a collision course — the setting is the divided Crown Heights neighborhood in Brooklyn — but he is also suggesting how much the two groups have in common. The Rastafarian rappers and the Hasidic celebrators find inspiration in the same biblical tale: that of the love of King Solomon for the Queen of Sheba. It's that very tale, reinforced by references to &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;West Side Story,&quot; that shapes the movie. - Dave Kehr",2916,1

"A screenwriter's own particular brand of self-disgust is combined with the germy self-hatred of the game-show creator and host Chuck Barris in &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,&quot; which was written by Charlie Kaufman (&quot;Adaptation&quot;). The whole is less than the sum of its parts: the dueling Kaufman and Barris takes on self-flagellation don't exactly mesh. This film, a shape-shifting apologia-biopic as weird as &quot;Adaptation,&quot; is too cold for its own good. George Clooney, though, in his directorial debut, does show an eye, and a head, for filmmaking. There's a casual irony in the details, with &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot; (based on Mr. Barris's unreliable &quot;unauthorized autobiography&quot; of the same name) making jokes of the lurid minutiae of the life of Mr. Barris, who in his day was accused of the destruction of television, Western civilization and the World as We Know It. — Elvis Mitchell",2925,1
"&quot;Quadrophenia,&quot; which is derived very, very loosely from an album by the Who, is set in England in 1964, and populated by Mods and Rockers, warring bands of teenagers who speak with such thick accents that American audiences may find their conversation indecipherable. But its foreigness has perverse advantages, helping to receast situations that might seem commonplace in an American end-of-adolescence movie, and making them just remote enough to seem fresh. The director, Franc Roddam, lends the film a clarity of emotion that keeps it from becoming too confusing. - Janet Maslin",2926,1

"Finally, a serial killer movie so preposterous, so garnished with accidental laugh lines and absent essential narrative logic it may actually put a permanent kibosh on this tediously overworked crime subgenre. Here's hoping, at any rate. Directed with self-conscious hothouse flair by E. Elias Merhige, from a puzzler of a screenplay credited to Zak Penn and Billy Ray, &quot;Suspect Zero&quot; involves a serial killer who's doing away with other serial killers and the disgraced F.B.I. agent who refuses to let this meta-murder madness go unpunished. Think &quot;Seven&quot; minus the talent. Soon after the agent Thomas Mackelway (Aaron Eckhart) lands in the F.B.I.'s Albuquerque bureau, he discovers a man's mutilated body carefully arranged amid the cacti and sand. One thing leads to another leads to a halfway house where twitchy Benjamin O'Ryan (Ben Kingsley) scratches out the kind of eerily beautiful artwork so beloved of movie sociopaths. As Mackelway tracks O'Ryan, it soon appears that the hunter and the hunted may be on the same horrific page even if the director and the screenwriters are not. — Manohla Dargis",2951,1

"This movie is about a down-to-his-last-Bentley director, Viktor Taransky (Al Pacino), who finds success with a virtual superstar, Simone. His discovery is a computer-generated actress &#151; a brilliantly devised computer program that serendipitously falls into Taransky's  hands.  Plotwise, this is a virtual &quot;Tootsie,&quot; and the director Andrew Niccol gets some lightweight farce out of Taransky's straining to keep the world away from his nonexistent prodigy, a task that becomes all the more difficult once Simone becomes the biggest star in the world. The problem is that Simone herself isn't as exciting a cyberpresence as the video-game icon Lara Croft. Mr. Niccol's &quot;Simone&quot; is like the punch line to a joke that's been going around for years. It has been told better, and been funnier, elsewhere. — Elvis Mitchell",2953,1

This is the vehicle through which Thrax, an evil virus voiced by Laurence Fishburne, enters his body. Throughout Jones's fantastic voyage through Frank's body, there are many small but tasteless jokes that will make children giggle and their parents sigh with exasperation. The live-action portion of &quot;Osmosis Jones&quot; is more of a cartoon than the animated part.

"The awkward directorial debut of Elia Zois, who wrote the screenplay with his father, Christ Zois. Monotonously paced, overlong and unpersuasive, &quot;Jersey Guy&quot; pits the virtues of life in New Jersey against the glamour and sophistication of New York. The tale's hero is Jack (Steve Parlavecchio). In his early 20's, he is a product of a community college who lives with his parents and younger brother, works as an assistant administrator in the Happy Acres nursing home, is a self-proclaimed connoisseur of pizza and has been going out for seven years with the cute blond Susan (Stacy Mistysyn), while enjoying the sex but ducking marriage. One night, on an outing to a club in SoHo, Jack stumbles into a situation that he readily admits happens only in movies. A fashion model named Samantha (Jill Wolfe) finds him attractive. Soon Jack is lying to Susan, feeling guilt, dressing in black and making his way across the Hudson to be introduced to fashion shoots, sushi, Sam's bed, cynical parasites who date models and the life of the Hamptons.

Its characters cope with idleness, marital distress and the strain that unemployment has placed on their friendships. The movie, which is sometimes poignant, often feels meandering and anecdotal. Having established his point vividly and early — that joblessness entails the loss of manhood — Mr. Aranoa is content to repeat it, sometimes humorously, sometimes bitterly. But this slow, episodic film is held together by the strong performances of the cast, and especially by the galvanic presence of Javier Bardem, who plays Santa, the angriest and most reckless of the men, and the only one willing to try, however quixotically, to rebel against their sad circumstances. — A.O.

The old lady, while monstrously manipulative and stubborn, might also represent an indomitable urban life force resisting the forces of gentrification. — A. O. Scott",3012,1

Its  subject, Stephen Dale Fielding, is the victim of severe child abuse with a long criminal  record, who during the filming of his story was arrested (he was eventually convicted) for  sexually abusing his 8-year-old cousin. A childlike man of limited intelligence and no  impulse control, Stevie, as he is called, is not entirely unsympathetic, but he isn't  especially likable either. We meet his sister Brenda, the grandmother Verna, who cared  for him after his mother, Bernice, dumped him in her lap, and his mentally retarded  girlfriend Tonya. The movie, set in the hardscrabble rural world of southern Illinois, compellingly argues that the physical and psychic wounds inflicted on children  leave irreparable damage and lead to lifelong social dysfunction. — Stephen Holden",3046,1

Mr. Cajayon's modest version is sometimes amateurishly acted by the appealing younger cast but is nonetheless a neat blend of well-drawn major characters and drama, music, dance, romance and humor that generates considerable charm and achieves a heartwarming resolution of its generational conflict. — Lawrence Van Gelder",3052,1

"In &quot;Zero Day,&quot; the teenaged high schooler Cal (Calvin Robertson) has a sarcastic mantra that he often utters: &quot;These are the best years of our lives.&quot; But the first time he says it in director Ben Coccio's drama sets the tone. It's late at night, and Cal and his best friend, Andre (Andre Keuck), are planning an assault on their school. &quot;We are the army of two,&quot; they chant, flexing and posing for the camera. Teen assassins Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, and the murderous attack they unleashed on Columbine High School in 1999, are the basis of Mr. Coccio's loose, low-key film, which he wrote with his older brother, Chris. The rambling course of &quot;Day&quot; &#151; it's structured as a video diary, with segments from both Cal and Andres camera's &#151;  means that some of the segments take on more weight than others. Still , the movie is often compelling, because of individual moments in each installment as the date of the attack grows near. The movie's power comes because even the most innocuous moments in Andre and Cals lives are shadowed by dread. &#151; Elvis Mitchell).",3069,1

He has been strongly influenced, as a man and as an artist, by his African heritage and the Yoruban gods, goddesses and saints of Santería, which fuses Afro-Cuban and Roman Catholic elements of religion. These influences, along with Picasso, Miró and Dali, among others, are manifest in his work. &#151; Lawrence Van Gelder",3093,1

The scenes, introduced &quot;Cabaret&quot;-style by a smirking, androgynous master of ceremonies, portray a society so at odds with itself it is on the verge of committing mass suicide.

"Amir Naderi's independent feature concludes the New York trilogy this gifted Iranian filmmaker began with &quot;Manhattan by Numbers&quot; (1992) and &quot;A, B, C . . . Manhattan&quot; (1997).  His protagonist is Gretchen (Sara Paul), a young woman with a curious obsession:  once each year, she goes on a personal marathon, in which she tries to complete as many crossword puzzles as possible during a 24-hour period while riding the underground trains. By performing this strange, private ritual (a tradition she has inherited from her mother) in the most public and chaotic of places, Gretchen seems to be waging her own private war against the meaningless din of urban existence.   As absurd as her gesture may be, it is one way of imposing order on arbitrariness &#151; just as is Mr. Naderi's act in making this intriguing miniature. &#151; Dave Kehr",3148,1
"Catherine Jelski's debut feature follows a fateful day in the life of Charlie Fox (well played by Devon Gummersall, onetime heartthrob of the television series &quot;Felicity&quot;), the spoiled and soulless 20-ish son of a vastly successful British film director. Holed up with his willowy Spanish girlfriend, Paloma (Arly Jover), in his father's mid-century mansion in the Hollywood Hills, Charlie awakes amid a litter of cigarette butts and empty liquor bottles, stirs up a pitcher of martinis and starts behaving abusively. Ms. Jelski has a genuine gift for handling actors, but her film is limited by the judgmental, moralistic undertone that throbs throughout. By the time we are allowed to see Charlie as a victim as well as a victimizer, the revelation seems too little and too late to elicit any real sympathy. &#151; Dave Kehr",3149,1

The story, for all its length, is swift sometimes to the point of haste as momentous events are skipped over or noted in passing. But Mr. Assayas's meticulous sense of detail and his intuitive sense of the rush and confusion of human passions &#151; sexual, religious and material &#151; rescue &quot;Les Destin&#233;es&quot; from the stale pageantry that afflicts so many period dramas. — A.

"The high-toned accouterments that signify the &quot;Masterpiece Theater&quot; style of wistful Anglophilia cannot redeem &quot;The Heart of Me,&quot; an undercooked romantic drama set largely in London in the 1930's and 40's, from dullness. The story, adapted from Rosamond Lehmann's 1953 novel &quot;The Echoing Grove,'' is a fable of betrayal and forgiveness in which high-strung, bohemian Dinah (Helena Bonham Carter) recklessly embarks on a long-term affair with Rickie (Paul Bettany), the husband of her proper sister Madeleine (Olivia Williams). The theme of forgiveness is blared in an early scene in which the clandestine lovers, romping through idyllic countryside, pore over a singsong verse by William Blake that invokes mutual forgiveness for &quot;all eternity.'' Before the movie is over, the reiteration of that verse (the 1930's literary equivalent of Their Song) has become an annoying tic. — Stephen Holden",3162,1

And this makes his ultimate triumph, over a convoluted and sinister scheme involving diamonds, DNA and weather-altering satellites, all the more satisfying. Lee Tamahori is not a natural action director, especially in the large-scale chase and shootout sequences, and the climax, aboard a flaming jetliner, is more numbing than thrilling.

"Michael Winterbottom, a prolific and stylistically promiscuous director (&quot;The Claim,&quot; &quot;24 Hour Party People,&quot; &quot;In This World&quot;) tries his able hand at dystopian science fiction. Sometime in the future, the world is divided between gleaming, affluent cities and the world outside, called &quot;afuera&quot; in the global polyglot idiom. An insurance investigator (Tim Robbins) comes to Shanghai to investigate a factory that is producing counterfeit travel documents, and falls into a brief affair with the prime suspect (Samantha Morton). The story and the characters, mopily played by the two lead actors, are less interesting than the futuristic ambience Mr. Winterbottom has gleaned from the realities of the present. Rather than relying on special effects or elaborate set design, he filmed &quot;Code 46&quot; in Shanghai and Dubai, in the fluorescence of airport and hotels and the neon and dust of urban streets.

What strife there is mostly involves his father, Edward (Colin  Firth), an eccentric fiery-eyed inventor, and his Uncle Morris (Malcolm  McDowell), who brings home a beautiful French wife (Irene Jacob), with whom Edward falls in love. If the story is slight, it is smoothly told and well acted (especially by Mr. Firth), and the nostalgic atmosphere is beguiling. &#151; Stephen Holden",3233,1

It turns out there is quite a lot that the endlessly recycled and diluted images of the storied counterculture have obscured about some of the most interesting and vital parts of the culture itself, which the filmmakers have brought triumphantly to life. The movie chronicles the history of a loosely organized collective of drag performers, and in the process illuminates the idealistic, anarchic spirit of the times, its sexual politics, and the tensions between free-form experimentation and the demands of showbiz success. — A.

Sean Penn and Nick Nolte play a pair of embittered brothers dealing with the consequences of the old man's passing, and there is great pleasure to be had in watching these Method powerhouses  at work.

"This French film about the sexual coming  of age of two 15-year-old girls who have been best friends since childhood has an  incandescent performance by Isild Le Besco as Gwen, a teenager metamorphosing from a  tomboy into a reckless, boy-crazy woman-child. As her introspective and (possibly lesbian) pal Lise, Karen Alyx gives an equally strong portrayal of a young woman desperately playing sexual catch-up.

Bruno Dumont does not trust  words to convey reality. Like his earlier two movies, &quot;La Vie de Jesus&quot; and &quot;Humanite,&quot;  &quot;Twentynine Palms&quot; (his first film made in the United States) portrays a relentlessly ominous world in which humans are just another form of animal life and a potentially  dangerous one, ruled by brute instincts and volatile emotions. What makes his films riveting to those who can stomach them (and many can't) is his gift for putting on the  screen the quivering essence of physical life as its experienced moment by moment. — Stephen Holden",3293,1

So, working from a screenplay by Frank Cottrell Boyce (&quot;Hilary and Jackie&quot;), the director, Julien Temple (&quot;Absolute Beginners&quot;), infuses his film with elements of political rebelliousness colored by the French Revolution, government surveillance and repression, utopianism, scientific innovation, respect for nature, drug use and popular stardom of the sort that prompts the press to clamor and young women to swoon. &#151; Lawrence Van Gelder",3305,1

"This Japanese animated film, directed by Hatsuki Tsuji, consists of an extended round of Yu-Gi-Oh!, a card game based on a Japanese comic book that has become enough of a craze among American children to support a television series (on the Kids WB! Network) and a cycle of video games as well.  The picture is little more than a commercial for the game, which constantly requires players to purchase new cards for their playing decks. The slight plot consists of a protracted duel between the game's goodhearted adolescent champ, Yugi, and his arch-rival, a greedy teenaged video game entrepreneur named Kaiba.  The animation is execrable and the suspense sub-minimal. — Dave Kehr",3308,1

But for much of its running time, &quot;Fire&quot; is loads of fun. It has a jamming B-picture buzz — the kind of swift filmmaking and high spirits that have been missing from movies for a while. The picture starts in contemporary London, when a little boy crawls into an underground space that looks part catacomb and part bowel.

For a while, this glib thriller, directed with reasonable skill by Mathieu Kassovitz, will manage to quicken your pulse and keep you in a state of nervous anticipation. In the end, though, as the ghost-story clichés collide with the serial killer clichés and the women-behind-bars clichés give way to the wronged-women-seeking-revenge clichés, the movie proves to be both too much and not enough — yet another slick, empty package of ersatz entertainment, at once overwrought and under-thought. — A.

The picture does get a couple of laughs out of its premise: Steve Martin, once again playing a proto-WASP &#151; this time, Peter, a repressed tax lawyer &#151; is taken in by the bright, intelligent e-mails he gets from someone whose online sobriquet is &quot;lawyergirl.&quot; But on their first blind date, Peter learns that lawyergirl is Charlene (Queen Latifah), a convicted bank robber claiming her innocence who wants Peter's help in getting the charges dropped. &quot;Bringing Down the House&quot; lives up to its name, and not in a good way. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",3393,1

The faithful screen  adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis's second novel plays provocatively with time (some  sequences are run backward), and it does hold your attention. But the movie fails to develop fully fleshed characters, and its in-your-face portrayal of campus anomie and  depravity has the hysterical tone of a spoiled adolescent thumbing his nose at his uptight  parents. — Stephen Holden",3425,1

"A lumpy blend of sweet teen romance and naughty, R-rated prurience, this comedy follows the improbable relationship between Matt (Emile Hirsch), a high-achieving high school senior, and Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert), a former porn star. That the film contains wildly contradictory notions about sex and pornography — one moment it is celebrating, the next shaking its head in concern — is hardly surprising. Why should it be different from anything else? What is scandalous is how little humor it squeezes out of its sleazy premise. Timothy Olyphant, as a snaggle-toothed hipster who produced Danielle's films, gives the only performance that shows any inventiveness or wit. He's a liar, a user, a sociopath and a thief, and by far the classiest thing in the picture. — A. O. Scott",3455,1

Commanding the submarine is Lieutenant Brice (Bruce Greenwood), who assumed the helm when the original captain died under mysterious circumstances.

The first one, called &quot;Fiction,&quot; chronicles the humiliation of an undergraduate creative writing student (Selma Blair), and, in about 20 minutes, lays waste to some deeply cherished pieties and unacknowledged superstitions about race, sex and disability. The second part, &quot;Non-Fiction,&quot; follows a hapless filmmaker (Paul Giammatti) into the kinky banality of suburban family life. With unerring satirical intelligence, Mr. Solondz takes aim at his characters, his audience and himself, but his pitiless anatomy of human awfulness also contains a surprising, unsentimental streak of sympathy. – A.

But &quot;Scotland, Pa.,&quot; which is set in a fast-food outlet in rural Pennsylvania during the 1970's, doesn't have a language other than the desultory slang of 70's Middle America.

"John Crowley uses the warm rapport of ensemble acting to take the jaggedness out of the rough-and-tumble vivacity of digital-video moviemaking. The result is this altogether compelling Irish comedy-drama. The first scene of the picture serves as an announcement of its intentions and is emblematic of the film's approach. Strolling into a restaurant and trilling his consonants as if he were trying to add an extra layer of moss to his accent, the roguish Lehiff (Colin Farrell) wins over the girl behind the counter, and the scene spins wildly into something else entirely. The shock &#151;  both comic and finally horrific  &#151; gives the movie the fizz of unpredictability. Surprise hovers over &quot;Intermission&quot; like a creature waiting to stun the cast of the movie into submission.  What Mr. Crowley and the screenwriter Mark Rowe have done is assemble a group of actors whose feistiness keeps the doom that drips around the corners of the frame from consuming them all whole. The tangle of intersecting lives is what keep the movie thorny, and forces the actors to stay alert.  Though a bank robbery is fundamentally the center of the action, following the characters around is really what &quot;Intermission&quot; is all about. It's as if the movie is an intermission for Mr. Crowley from the rigid demands of plot and theme that crop up so often in his stage work. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",3493,1

"A movie featuring Ice Cube bellowing &quot;No more profanity!&quot; — and meaning it — should produce a lot more laughs than this intermittently amusing sequel.  This film seems to be &quot;All About the Benjamins,&quot; to use the title of an Ice Cube action comedy. Most of the decisions involving this sequel to the spirited original &quot;Barbershop&quot; — a movie that itself cobbled together pieces of other projects — are about carefully retracing the steps of that 2002 hit in order to keep those $100 Benjamins flowing. But although Ice Cube's business sense is right on the money, the minor surprises of the first film are gone.  Ice Cube returns as star and executive producer of &quot;Barbershop 2.&quot; His Calvin Palmer provides the common sense that holds the shop together, a glue it desperately needs. When the moneyed inner-city entrepreneur Quentin Leroux (Harry Lennix) builds a lavish competitor called Nappy Cutz right across the street from Calvin's shop, the battle is on — Calvin has to fight to keep his business alive. The bittersweet aspects of the film add texture, though they can't supplant the lack of comedy; there were more laughs in Ice Cube's last picture, &quot;Torque.&quot; — Elvis Mitchell",3498,1

"Jesse Peretz's video feature presents the latest installment of the continuing drama that is Franco-American relations. The premise is familiar from old comic horror films: two naïve Americans inherit a castle in the European countryside, and when they arrive to claim their prize, they find a decaying Gothic nightmare, loaded with debt and in drastic need of repair. The Americans experience the French as surly, distant and rude; the French experience the Americans as loud, overly familiar and rude. The script toys with the notion of the freedom-loving Yankees coming to liberate the old-world serfs from the shackles of oppressive tradition, but ultimately &quot;The Chateau&quot; is less concerned with cultural and political issues than doting on its eccentric characters. — Dave Kehr",3510,1

"This holocaust documentary is built around a shocking piece of information: that a performer was so consumed by the need to express himself before an audience that he participated in a horrifying lie. The German Jewish actor and cabaret performer Kurt Gerron was recruited by the Nazis to create a propaganda documentary about Theresienstadt to divert the suspicions of the Red Cross. The footage of Gerron, hard at work constructing his mammoth and monstrous fiction, is one of the most numbing spectacles you're likely to see in a film, nonfiction or otherwise. &quot;A grotesque and shameful lie,&quot; says Ian Holm in voiceover narration, and he also describes the obscene misinformation conjured by the Nazis to hide what was really a concentration camp: &quot;a self-sustaining commune of like-minded people: artists, scientists, craftsmen and entertainers.&quot; &quot;Paradise&quot; eventually posits the notion that Gerron was a lost soul himself; he refuses Peter Lorre's offer to bring him and his family to America because the trip can't be booked in first class. He's so subservient to what he believes his station to be that his life becomes like the operatic tragedies directed by Josef von Sternberg or G. W. Pabst; he's undone by his own hubris, which he finally comes to recognize too late. The story rolls to a recap of the opening moments &#151; the making of the faked film, which a Red Cross observer is invited to see. Gerron's childlike self-absorption makes him an object of pity, and several of the witnesses are forgiving of his behavior. His final fate &#151; he was later shipped to Auschwitz &#151; could be a reason for their attitudes toward him. But the real question posed by &quot;Prisoner of Paradise&quot; &#151; for what price does a man sell his soul, and is it worth it? &#151; is never really answered. That is what a great film often does, but this one seems to just drift to a close instead of pronouncing an end. That can be the result of wrestling with an immense piece of material, and not being up to its demands. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",3519,1

The film, adapted from a novel by Simon Leys, stars Ian Holm in the dual roles of Napoleon and Eugene, the drunken, buffoonish deckhand and look-alike who becomes his stand-in. Although there's plenty of opportunity for low comedy in the notion of an emperor and an oaf exchanging roles, &quot;The Emperor's New Clothes,&quot; much to its detriment, doesn't pursue them.

"Meticulously adapted from two novellas by Andre Dubus, John Curran's film is a somber anatomy of two marriages in crisis. Mark Ruffalo's Jack, who teaches literature at a small college, is having an affair with Edith (Naomi Watts), the wife of his best friend, a writer named Hank (Peter Krause), who has a fling with Jack's wife, Terry (Laura Dern). It is all a bit too symmetrical — a bedroom farce without a sense of humor — and the characters float free of any credible social context. But this dark, cracked crystal of a film nonetheless works as a kind of marital film noir, with the threat of emotional violence hanging over every scene. The actors give brave, unshowy performances, especially Ms. Dern, who lets go of any trace of actorly vanity, and Mr. Ruffalo, who portrays male weakness with an honesty rarely seen in American movies. — A.

"David Strathairn delivers one of the most exquisitely nuanced performances of his career as Mr. Auster, a high-school English teacher tempted to seduce his star pupil, Meg (Agnes Bruckner), a beautiful and talented aspiring poet. The characters are carefully rendered in shades of gray. The teacher is a sensitive aesthete and a caring friend but also a lecher and a literary impostor. Meg, who grew up with her mother and her emotionally troubled younger sister in a home scarred by divorce, is part angel, part surly teenage rebel. The movie is an impressive debut for the director Karen Moncrieff, whose wised-up psychological radar takes in both sides of every situation. — Stephen Holden",3593,1

With their uncompromising, almost unbearable rigor and their ruthless refusal of melodrama, the brothers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne mount an implicit critique of the therapeutic nostrums and the vigilante fantasies to which we have become accustomed, putting both the slick, pretentious pandering of &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; and the earnest hand-wringing of &quot;In the Bedroom&quot; to shame. Nothing about &quot;The Son&quot; is easy, and it has the balked, minimalist force (as well as the working-class setting) of one of Raymond Carver's better stories.

Peter Mullan is the mayor whose past comes back to haunt him, and Nastassja Kinski and Sarah  Polley, the wife and daughter he sold years earlier for the gold-mining claim that made him  rich.

"Veronica Guerin was a Dublin journalist who was murdered in 1996 by the drug-dealers whose activities she had worked to expose. According to the text that appears onscreen at the end of Joel Schumacher's biopic, her death incited public outrage and spurred the passage of new laws, which helped to ease the drug-trafficking and related criminality that had plagued Ireland for so long. Unfortunately, those end titles, and the ones at the beginning, are the most informative portions of the film, as well as the most powerful. What comes between them is a flat-footed, overwrought crusader-against-evil melodrama, in which Cate Blanchett's formidable gifts as an actress are reduced to a haircut and an accent. Her Veronica Guerin bravely mocks and harasses various thugs and lowlifes, and consoles her worried co-workers and family members, but the movie is devoid of both dramatic intensity and genuine emotion. It feels so much like so many other similar, better movies that you forget that it is based on an actual life, which could never have been so laden with cliché. — A. O. Scott",3727,1

Although none of the three could be described as cheery, &quot;Naqoyqatsi,&quot; whose title is the Hopi Indian term for war as a way of life, reeks of doomsday. Its relentless depiction of competition, regimentation and universal bellicosity inevitably reflects an international political climate charged with mounting fears of war and terrorism.

But it establishes its ominous mood and tension swiftly, and if the suspense never rises to a higher level, it is nevertheless maintained throughout. &#151; Lawrence Van Gelder",3771,1

Kevin Spacey is earnest but unconvincing as Quoyle, the novel's sad-sack protagonist who moves to Newfoundland with his aunt (Judi Dench) and takes a job writing the shipping news for a local newspaper. The movie can't find a screen equivalent for the book's quirky hard-bitten language, which creates a world unto itself. – Stephen Holden",3783,1

"In its first half-hour, &quot;Stander,&quot; which tells the true story of Andre Stander (Tom Jane), the Johannesburg police chief who in 1976 turned against an apartheid system he found repugnant, and became a notorious serial bank robber, plays like a smoothly executed, if predictable drama of one man's heroic rebellion. Just when you begin to relax and wait for the usual buttons to be pushed, it swerves in more  uncertain direction and becomes an unsettling character study of a man self-destructively  addicted to flouting authority that is camouflaged as a heist movie. The further the volatile title  character evolves into a swaggering self-styled Robin Hood, the more his luster begins to  tarnish. Much of the film's considerable power lies in Mr. Jane's raw physical dynamism. — Stephen Holden",3789,1

"With the use of staged, pseudo-documentary sequences, Kevin Macdonald's British film reconstructs the disastrous 1985 attempt that Joe Simpson and Simon Yates made on the 21,000 foot Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes.  All went well for three days, until Mr. Simpson fell and drove his lower leg into his kneecap, leaving him crippled.  Mr. Yates tried to lower Mr. Simpson down the mountainside with a climbing rope, but accidentally lowered him into a deep crevasse.  Receiving no response from his partner, Mr. Yates was faced with a terrible choice:  either to stay and hold on to the rope, at the risk of being eventually pulled into the ravine by Mr. Simpson's body weight, or to cut the rope and attempt to save himself. This is compelling stuff, but there is something deeply distracting in the use of recreated material.  Mr. Macdonald, the director, imitates a raw, video-based cinema-verite style, but fairly often places the camera in locations that would be inaccessible to a cameraman on the actual expedition (for example, when Mr. Simpson falls into the crevasse, the camera crew is already there to meet him. — Dave Kehr",3801,1
"Determinedly un-hip and utterly engaging, the sequel to &quot;Stuart Little&quot; (based on E.B. White's classic children's book) is even better than the original. Once again, the blend of live action and animation is virtually seamless. The characters are more sharply  drawn than before, the newest addition being a duplicitous jewel-thieving bird (voiced by  Melanie Griffith) under the thumb of an evil falcon (James Woods). The role of the  spoiled family housecat Snowbell (Nathan Lane) has been beefed up, and Mr. Lane turns the  character's every peevish complaint into an amusing comic barb. The zesty action  sequences find Stuart tooling wildly around New York and doing battle with the falcon in  a model airplane. This is one family film franchise that respects the innocence of  childhood without becoming saccharine. — Stephen Holden",3802,1

"Frankie Muniz, the now 18-year-old urchin of &quot;Malcolm in the Middle,&quot; is back as a 16-year-old C.I.A. operative in this sequel to the fitfully entertaining &quot;Agent Cody Banks.&quot;   The subversive humor that occasionally brightened the first film — the notion, for example, that an innocuous summer camp is actually a high-tech C.I.A. training base for child agents — is absent from this sophomore effort, as is Hilary Duff, the highly popular teenage actress whose co-starring role in the first &quot;Cody&quot; likely had a lot to do with the film's success.  Otherwise, things are pretty much the same, as the screenwriters Don Rhymer, Harald Zwart and Dylan Sellers do their best to duplicate the first film's blend of James Bondish adventure and adolescent anxieties. Young Cody is assigned by the director of the C.I.A. (Keith David) to track down the rogue agent Diaz (Keith Allen), who was once Cody's trainer at C.I.A. camp but has now joined the evil English aristocrat Lord Kenworth (James Faulkner) in a mad plot to rule the world by implanting mind-controlling microchips in the molars of world leaders.  Directed by the British filmmaker Kevin Allen (&quot;Twin Town,&quot; &quot;The Big Tease&quot;), &quot;Cody Banks 2&quot; is full of chase sequences and comic battles, but Mr. Allen's work is compromised by an apparent inability to match his shots in a spatially coherent fashion.  It's never easy to tell who is chasing whom and in which direction, a needless confusion that dampens many of the thrills and scuttles quite a few of the gags. — Dave Kehr",3808,1

"&quot;Dead or Alive&quot; has the wild, nasty sweep of an adult-theme anime.

The director, Takashi Miike, wants to freak out his audiences, but his ideas are third-generation copies from masters with a real taste for perversity.

But on a deeper level, the movie is a meditation on the seething frustrations  of living under a stage of siege. Jerusalem, as seen through the Palestinian filmmaker's  eyes, is a gridlocked power keg where hostile Israeli soldiers aim their guns at the tiniest  hint of trouble and roadblocks and checkpoints make living a normal life almost impossible.  Ms. Khoury offers a deeply sensitive, unsentimental portrait of young woman torn by  doubt in a climate ruled by fear and suspicion. &#151; Stephen Holden",3820,1
"As a movie, this tale of a benefit concert organized in the middle of a civil war, is an unholy, incoherent mess. As a Bob Dylan artifact, though, it exercises an undeniable fascination. Mr. Dylan plays Jack Fate, a gnomic folk singer released from prison into a squalid, magic-realist landscape of drunken journalists (Jeff Bridges), and sleazy showbiz types (Jessica Lange and John Goodman) and ranting would-be prophets (most of the rest of the cast). Were it not for a handful of first-rate musical performances (and a soundtrack featuring Turkish and Italian covers of some of Mr. Dylan's best-known songs), the movie would be a cultist's curio. As it is, it leaves you guessing about just how seriously it takes itself and, in time-honored Dylan tradition, both invites and confounds endless, earnest exegesis. — A. O. Scott",3821,1

"The mastery of filmmaking hasn't abated in &quot;Reloaded&quot; — the Wachowskis are as suited to the task of guiding this sequel to their surprise 1999 hit as their unsure hero, Neo (Keanu Reeves), is to saving the world. Though the staging of the action sequences is as viciously elegant as you've been primed to expect, there's a dispiriting more-of-the-same aspect to the picture. The mentor Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and the virtual villain Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) also return, and a whole new group of characters surface as Neo, his lover, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), and the crew continue to fight the oppressive forces threatening to eliminate humanity and the hidden city of Zion. As the middle film of a trilogy, &quot;Reloaded&quot; seeks to increase the emotional stakes — which it doesn't quite accomplish — while leaving enough of a cliffhanger that audiences will be bedeviled enough to flock back into the tents for the last portion. The directors pay their audiences the unlikely compliment of taking them seriously. Unfortunately, they take themselves too seriously. However, &quot;Reloaded&quot; has one of the most excitingly subversive and radical points of view ever seen in a major motion picture — a postmodern purview that accords philosophical ideals from people of color equal weight. This includes the warmhearted spotlight given to Gloria Foster, who returns as Oracle, the source of all knowledge for Neo. — Elvis Mitchell",3890,1
"For its first few minutes, this romantic comedy, directed by a veteran builder of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; star vehicles, looks like another crude, bullying Adam Sandler extravaganza: there are vulgar sexual jokes, a vomiting walrus and the never entirely welcome appearance of Rob Schneider, who plays a Hawaiian stoner named Ula. But then Drew Barrymore shows up as Lucy, a lovely art teacher suffering from temporal lobe damage, and everything starts looking up. She goes after Mr. Schneider with a baseball bat, and engages Mr. Sandler, who plays an easy-going, womanizing veterinarian, in a clever and touching romantic comedy. The film's conceit — Lucy's injury has destroyed her short-term memory, so that she starts each day with no recollection of the one before — is reminiscent of Harold Ramis's immortal &quot;Groundhog Day.&quot; While &quot;50 First Dates,&quot; deftly directed by Peter Segal from George Wing's witty and heartfelt script, does not have that film's philosophical ambitions, it does follow its premise to a risky conclusion that pays off beautifully. — A. O. Scott",3891,1
"When the masters of the drive-in movie at American-International Pictures ran out of ideas for beach party films in the early 60's, they came up with &quot;Ski Party,&quot; a 1965 production that simply transferred the eternal themes of the beach genre — revealing clothing, practical jokes and uncertainty over how far to go in sex and romance in the absence of adult supervision — to the side of a mountain. That memorable creative choice now has its descendant in &quot;Out Cold,&quot; a ski party movie in which the clothes are a little more revealing than they were 35 years ago, the practical jokes are a little more tasteless, and the uncertainty over sex is pretty much nonexistent. Most crucial, instead of surfboards there are snowboards. – Dave Kehr",3892,1

Like the films of his mentor, Andrei Tarkovsky, Mr. Sokurov's are soulful, enigmatic and irreducibly Russian. This one, the second part of a projected trilogy on the subject of familial love, concerns a father and a son who live together in a dramatically lighted apartment in an unidentified city. Mr. Sokurov explores their relationship with intimate lyricism and intense sensuality; at times they seem more like lovers than like parent and child. The film is difficult, but if you succumb to its slow, elegiac rhythms and engage its obscure, aching sentiments you may find yourself haunted and moved. &#151; A. O. Scott",3953,1

"This taut contemporary wartime thriller set in the Balkans  is a machine-tooled rescue drama that sustains a relentless buzzing energy. Owen Wilson is a cocky naval aviator, Burnett, who breaks the rules and is shot down by Serbian  anti-aircraft weapons during a reconnaissance mission. Gene Hackman is his commander, Admiral Reigart, who violates the ceasefire in effect and authorizes a rescue mission. If the dual manhunt and race-against-time stories are strictly formulaic, the movie is swiftly  paced, well acted and very much in the gung-ho patriotic spirit of the moment. – Stephen Holden",3957,1

But the phrasing of the question gives away the answer: this is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship. Ms. Bravo has done some impressive research, unearthing archival photographs and film of Mr. Castro and interviewing many of his friends and comrades, but to call her presentation of the man and his revolution one-sided would be an understatement. &quot;Fidel&quot; resembles nothing so much as the work of a second-rate Renaissance court painter devoted to the flattery of the subject rather than the accuracy of the portrait. — A.

But &quot;Bandits&quot; is guilty of behaving like a petty thievery corporation;  it steals from so many other sources that we're forced to realize that it has little of its own to offer. As such, it can't help but fail to meet expectations, given the talents involved. – Elvis Mitchell",3998,1

But it may be the first movie to blend traditionally romantic screen conventions with a clinical humor that radically desentimentalizes the rituals surrounding conception. - Stephen Holden",4017,1

"When one of the hopeful teenagers in this film, talking about his upcoming trip to America, remarks that &quot;The journey is like you are going to heaven,&quot; your heart sinks.  But in this well-organized and fascinating movie, the tidy and intelligent filmmakers Megan Mylan and Jon Shenk follow the accretions of small defeats that don't sap the will of the young Africans transplanted to the United States to make a better life for themselves. &quot;You are the future of Sudan,&quot; the boys are told as they prepare to leave their homeland. The film, which primarily follows two of the boys, Peter and Santino, over the course of a year, doesn't make us dread that line about a heaven that may not materialize. At its core, &quot;Sudan&quot; becomes about coping with loneliness, as alienation increases and both young men — like their newly arrived tribesmen — are orphaned into trying to stay afloat. Hearing the African teenagers joke about the customs they can no longer observe — like the familiar touching considered homosexual behavior in America — only italicizes the spiritual distance between America and Africa. The nearly unlimited access the directors have to the lives of their subjects intensifies the narrative, because it allows us to drift along in the swells and eddies of Peter and Santino's time in the United States. The filmmakers don't shy away from touchy issues, like the schism between the Sudanese and American blacks. Subtly, &quot;Lost Boys of Sudan&quot; provides a sense of what its subjects have traded — sacrificed, really — to come to America. Getting an audience so caught up is no small feat, and a tribute to the directors' storytelling. And though that early reference to heaven on earth — hovering and poised for contradiction — is answered by the end of &quot;Sudan,&quot; by then the film has earned the right to do so. — Elvis Mitchell",4020,1

It doesn't work. The bizarre outcome of this nervy conceptual hybrid is a movie that plays stylistic hopscotch as it jumps from one square to the next, teetering perilously each time it lands on one quaking ankle. Lurching between a loudmouthed sitcom and a crude social satire, the movie, directed by Daisy von Scherler Mayer from a screenplay by Tracey Jackson, also shoehorns three imitation Bollywood production numbers into its uneasy mix. &#151; A.

"Sofia Coppola's comic melodrama thoroughly and touchingly bridges the yawning gap between three standards of yearning in movies: David Lean's &quot;Brief Encounter,&quot; Richard Linklater's &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; and Wong Kar-wai's &quot;In the Mood for Love.&quot; The movie happens to be hilarious — a paean to dislocated people discovering how alive they are when they can barely keep their eyes open. The sexiness comes from the busy, desperate need-to-impress heat of a flirtation, an unrequited love communicated through a filter of sleep deprivation. &quot;Translation&quot; is also one of the purest and simplest examples ever of a director's falling in love with her star's gifts. And never has a director found a figure more deserving of her admiration than Bill Murray. He plays a vodka-and-bitters version of himself, and the persona that made him famous. His character, Bob, is an American movie star who's in Tokyo to participate in the celebrity not-so-secret shame: picking up a boatload of dough to appear in commercials for Suntory whiskey. While blinking sleeplessly around the hotel lobby of the majestically hermetic Tokyo Hyatt, he meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who has been abandoned by her husband, an ambitious photographer; he's off shooting a band. The movie follows the twists and connections in Bob and Charlotte's relationship; like some trans-Atlantic phone calls, their feelings reach each other on a five-second delay. The lag time only adds to the comedy, and heartbreak. — Elvis Mitchell",4105,1

"&quot;Circuit&quot; has a superficial resemblance to the low-budget exploitation films of the 1950's that purported to be cautionary tales about the dangers of sex, drugs and other big-city vices while offering plenty of titillating opportunities to sample, at least vicariously, those same vices. Like a dewy ingénue from one of those pictures, John (Jonathan Wade Drahos), the hero of Dirk Shafer's film, moves from a small town in Illinois (where he had been a police officer) to find love and adventure in West Hollywood. There he is drawn into a glittery demimonde of gay &quot;circuit parties,&quot; quasi-charitable, quasi-illegal events fueled by casual sex and copious drug use. &#151; A. O. Scott",4153,1

"What's bad? &quot;Sinbad,&quot; the newest animated feature with a boatload of celebrities slumming through another not-quite-thawed adventure story. To invoke the name of another underwhelming new film, &quot;Sinbad&quot; is legally bland. It stars Brad Pitt, who's such an actual avatar of golden-haired perfection that he's more credible as a cartoon; his under-inflected, slightly toasted-sounded arrogance seems less than fitting for a lusty, robust hero and con man and more in line with the stoner he played in &quot;True Romance.&quot; As it stands, kids will gravitate more toward his antic, commanding and inventive sidekick pooch. Or toward Eris, the capricious god of Chaos (Michelle Pfeiffer), whose need to stir up trouble isn't quite as grandiose as &quot;Sinbad&quot; requires. As Sinbad sails the film's marvelous computer-rendered seven seas on his mission, Eris conjures mischief. She's the otherworldly presence looming over the titular figure's peregrinations, and her mellifluous malevolence is one of the most distinctive elements the picture has to offer. With Catherine Zeta-Jones as the tomboy Marina, and Dennis Haysbert as the Nubian first mate who inspires lines that children may question. — Elvis Mitchell",4181,1

A prequel to &quot;The Exorcist,&quot; William Friedkin's 1973 shocker in which Ms. Blair played a child hijacked by Beelzebub, this new film comes gussied up with some fine talent (it stars Stellan Skarsgard as the same character played by Max von Sydow in the original) and a bag of cheap tricks, but when push comes to demonic shove hell apparently hath no fury like a woman in green pancake makeup just as surely as some producers hath no shame.

"Since his death in 1973, the country singer Gram Parsons's legend has become a figure of worshipful legend, to which this rambling, low-key movie makes a modest contribution. It tells the curious story of what happened to Parsons's body after his death: his road manager, Phil Kaufman (Mr. Knoxville) spirited the coffin away from the Los Angeles airport and drove it out to the desert, where he had promised to set in on fire. Kaufman is pursued by Parsons's grieving, straitlaced father (Robert Forster) and one of the singer's gold-digging ex-girlfriends (Ms. Applegate). Unfortunately, the most interesting character is the dead guy, and the movie is too flat-footedly anecdotal to reveal why anyone would care so much about him.

"Hal Hartley's movie sounds as if it's part of a new genre, slapstick magic realism, before it winds down into slapdash realism. The picture is more abrasively quirky than a lesser Bjork B-side, though the hideous monster who co-stars hails from Iceland, too. This fur-bearing creature (Robert John Burke), sporting monstrous fangs and suffering mundane depression, appears to us in a hilarious monologue complaining about the state of his life. This accomplishes a dual purpose, initially setting the tone for something a little different from the filmmaker's usual languid romance roundelays and evoking the philosophical dissatisfaction that all of Mr. Hartley's characters prattle on about.  It's such a cool maneuver, a deliberate spoof of what he has done in the past, that &quot;No Such Thing&quot; makes us believe that Mr. Hartley (&quot;Henry Fool,&quot; &quot;Simple Men&quot;) has a new trick up his tattered sleeve. – Elvis Mitchell",4308,1

"Mesmerizing is the only word to describe Tim Roth's profoundly sinister portrayal of a ruthless magician, hypnotist and mind reader in Werner Herzog's surreally flavored historical epic. His gleaming hair slicked back, his cold eyes glowing phosphorescently in his cadaverous head, Mr. Roth's character, who calls himself Erik Jan Hanussen, exudes the icy elegance of a European Gatsby who has just wafted up from the tomb. Much of &quot;Invincible&quot; is set in 1932 in the last days of Weimar Berlin, where Hanussen's mind-reading feats and back-room séances draw worshipful flocks of Hitler's brownshirts to his grand vaudeville palace in the heart of the city. &quot;Invincible&quot; is not just another parable about the evils of Nazism, but a broader allegory of history as show business. &#151; Stephen Holden",4370,1

Broadbent and Christopher Plummer as the ridiculous and implacable faces of evil &#151; romping in well-designed sets and costumes.

The answer is not altogether surprising, and at times &quot;Crimson Gold&quot; exhibits a finger-pointing didacticism as it exposes the cruelties and inequities of a society sharply polarized by class and corrupted by selfishness, snobbery and cynicism. But the occasional obviousness of the film s themes is more than balanced by the subtlety of its methods, and by the stolid, irreducible individuality of Mr. Emadeddin, a non-professional actor whose thick, impassive countenance charts Hussein's progress from weary irony to violent despair. — A.

"You could call this film the dark side of &quot;Spy Kids.&quot; Not only because a family is swept into the espionage biz — with a little boy as the bait used in a battle between a pair of disaffected spy-agency renegades — but also because the picture looks as if it were lighted with a 20-watt bulb. And it is dim in more ways than one. It pits the F.B.I. burnout Ecks (Antonio Banderas) against the superstar assassin Sever (Lucy Liu).  But all the director manages to prove is that he has seen the same action movies as the rest of us. Or, taking into consideration the wealth of purloined shots of dusters being flung across sinewy, kick-boxing ready hips, that he's seen &quot;The Matrix&quot; more times than the rest of us. — Elvis Mitchell",4427,1

"A group of free-grazing cattlemen is attacked by the minions of an evil rancher (Michael Gambon) and rides into town to take revenge. Kevin Costner, directing with his usual root-canal humorlessness, is aiming for the stark, mythic grandeur of the old westerns, but &quot;Open Range&quot; succeeds only in feeling simplistic and puffed up. As an actor in other people's movies, Mr. Costner is at his best when he unleashes his raffish, reckless charm, letting the good man and the bad boy duke it out for pre-eminence. Under his own direction, though, his self-regarding piety always wins. Every pause, every gesture, every grimace is fraught with significance, so that even his cowboy reticence comes to seem like shameless showboating. Annette Bening's performance, unfortunately, is well matched to Mr. Costner's; if the two of them were any more upstanding they'd be trees. Some of the supporting actors, notably Robert Duvall and Michael Jeter, throw off a few sparks of levity, but neither they nor the well-executed final shootout can prevent the movie from suffocating in its earnest self-seriousness. — A.

The successful kid rapper Bow Wow is a talented  actor whose boyish eagerness here is a marked contrast to his taciturn rappadocio. The director's breezy steadiness keeps the movie from hitting us over the head &#151; well, not too hard, anyway, no small feat since the steroid-juiced  sentimentality of the ending may force some to flee before the outtakes unspool under the credits. — Elvis Mitchell",4434,1

Michael Caine, appearing in flashbacks, plays Jack, a London butcher whose friends, along with his son (Ray Winstone), are journeying to the seaside to scatter his ashes. Along the way, they recall Jack's life, and their own small triumphs and disappointed hopes. The restrained humor of the actors, and the unassuming intelligence of Mr. Schepisi's storytelling, combine to create an extraordinarily rich portrait of a way of life, and a web of connections, that persist in the face of personal loss and historical change. – A.

"In 1952 Rudolf Slansky, the former secretary general of the Communist  Party of Czechoslovakia, was put on trial, along with 13 co-defendants, on charges of espionage and treason. Eleven of the defendants were Jewish, and 11 of the defendants, although not all the Jews, were sentenced to death and hanged. Composing a deft collage from archival material, including radio broadcasts and film clips from the trial and the reminiscences of survivors, Zuzana Justman's sensitive, intelligent documentary explores the cruel paradoxes that ensnared the defendants and casts light into the moral shadows of communism itself. — A.

"Tod Williams, avoiding the traps of sentimentality and overdone whimsy that lie in wait for adaptors of John Irving's fiction, has made a version of &quot;A Widow for One Year&quot; that is better than the book. Jon Foster plays Eddie, a prep school student who spends a long, eventful summer working as an assistant to Ted Cole (Jeff Bridges), a famous writer and illustrator of children's books. Ted and his wife, Marion (Kim Basinger), are still grieving over the loss of their two sons in a car accident years before, and their marriage is falling apart. All of this might have made for maudlin, precious melodrama — especially when Eddie and Marion commence their affair — but rather than emphasize the plot, Mr. Williams makes it a relaxed, roomy landscape for the characters to roam around in. The cast rises above the occasional implausibility of the material, and the movie is funny, touching and understated. It is dominated by Mr. Bridges's performance, one of the finest pieces of screen acting by an American man so far this year, a heroically life-sized portrait of wounded narcissism and masculine need. — A.

"Johnny Depp's sorrowful countenance is the still point at the center of this film's swirling hyperactivity, and his witty, spare performance gives the picture a poignancy that Ted Demme's hectic direction and the hurried script by David McKenna and Nick Cassavetes don't quite earn. Mr. Depp plays George Jung, a real-life drug dealer, whose life is presented as a brightly colored, fizzy tale of entrepreneurship and hedonism. The movie's sense of history is shallow — mostly a matter of costume design and soundtrack selections  — and it skims so quickly over George's giddy prime that his eventual downfall lacks emotional impact. Mr. Depp carries the picture, but it's a light and flimsy contraption masquerading as a pop epic. — A. O. Scott",4634,1

"Working with nonprofessional actors and a tiny budget, Siddiq Barmak's film is the first feature made in Afghanistan since before the rise of the Taliban — an impressive achievement made more so by the director's sure and subtle artistry. Without rancor, but also without averting his eyes from the cruelty of the Taliban's rule, Mr. Barmak paints a desolate picture of daily life under a capricious authoritarian regime that was especially harsh in its treatment of women. When her mother is chased out of her job at a dusty Kabul hospital, a young girl disguises herself as a boy and goes to work for a sympathetic shopkeeper, and as her ordeal reveals the many forms of Taliban brutality, the film also has moments of lyricism, tenderness and even comedy, as in one unforgettable sequence that explores the paradoxical idea of radical Islamist sex education. — A.

The film is at once a competent, somewhat contrived espionage thriller and a dizzily clever parody of spy-movie conventions. Pierce Brosnan, who has played James Bond, here subverts the 007 mystique, playing a sleazy, cynical MI-6 agent who bullies poor Harry into cooking up tales of intrigue that he can send back to the home office.

"This much too long, primitively plotted family action adventure has a handful of well-handled sequences. But given the young audience the film is intended for, the picture is like having to finish an entire pot of broccoli to have a couple of jelly beans for dessert. The expansive and fairly unbelievable movie follows Frank Hopkins (Viggo Mortensen), who's persuaded to leave Buffalo Bill's Wild West show to participate in the Ocean of Fire, a death-defying race across 3,000 miles of Arabian Desert. The prize is $100,000. But the real star of  &quot;Hidalgo&quot; is a handsome mustang with a white face and brown patches over each eye who gets more glamorous close-ups than Joan Crawford did in her entire career.  Eventually, Frank and Hidalgo's journey is a testament to Frank's need for validation, and is so full of incident that the movie is finally about as colorful, and convincing, as one of those penny dreadfuls about Buffalo Bill's own life. — Elvis Mitchell",4669,1

"Yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-Brits genre that was ushered in by &quot;The Full Monty&quot; and is still straining to produce another smash hit. This movie's would-be vaudevillians are the residents of Ogw, a cozy village in the Garw Valley in South Wales. What keeps the movie, written and directed by Sara Sugarman, from choking on its own cuteness is an undertone of satire that looks askance at the jolly villagers' bad taste and sentimentality. The movie's other asset is Rachel Griffiths's sturdy portrayal of the title character, the gawky, oppressed daughter of the local baker. Because Annie Mary couldn't be more different from Brenda, the neurotic, hyperarticulate shiatsu practitioner Ms. Griffiths plays on the HBO series &quot;Six Feet Under,&quot; the film role is quite a stretch. – Stephen Holden",4680,1
"Only 1,000?  That seems like a conservative estimate of the body count in this tribute to the splatter horror films of the 1970's by the heavy-metal rocker Rob Zombie. Alas, Mr. Zombie is both too much of a stylist, in that he's always self-consciously cutting away to oddball inserts, black-and-white flashbacks, negative images and other extraneous material, and too little, in that he is not in enough control of his means to let a mood grow and fester. And festering is what this genre is all about. — Dave Kehr",4681,1
"This sentimental comedy about a music-business publicist forced to care for his newborn daughter after his wife dies in childbirth is so false, icky and saddled with wince-making contrivances and fizzled jokes, it's the film equivalent of  making goo-goo noises and chucking a baby under the chin for a 103 minutes. Ben Affleck as the high-powered flack and reluctant father is tolerable as a selfish, arrogant,  Manhattan handmaiden to the stars. It's when he's required to change into a simpler, nicer guy that the actor gets into trouble, straining in vain to twist his natural sneer into a smile. The movie throws in a half-baked love story in which his character's friendship with a pliable video-store clerk (Liv Tyler) flowers into love. Ms. Tyler has never been  blander. Instead of a presence, she's an absence. — Stephen Holden",4682,1

"This atmospheric thriller is a muscular and dense exercise of skill and verve. (Ironically, this exercise may be the most adult film that Steven Spielberg has made in some time; it's about the bloody blurring of passion and violence — a compassionate noir.) In 2054, a law enforcement unit called Precrime exists to stop murders before they begin; three Precogs — beings who float in a nutrient-rich fluid — can predict when a crime will be committed and know the identity of the perpetrator. When the unit's chief, John Anderton, is accused of a crime he hasn't yet committed, he's soon on the run. Tom Cruise does as much sprinting in this picture as he has before in his entire filmography. The fluid bursts of quick-cut images seen on the monitors also show that Mr. Spielberg isn't about to be shown up by those quick-fingered, compulsively exhibitionistic upstarts like David Fincher. — Elvis Mitchell",4713,1

"Spike Lee's thoughtful, adulatory video documentary of the football legend, who is now 66, feels like two movies stuck together. The first half is a conventional biography of Mr. Brown's youth and dazzling athletic career, which he ended in 1966 to go into the movies. The second, more provocative half explores his career in Hollywood where he helped usher in the blaxploitation genre. It broaches such touchy subjects as racism and the myth of the black male stud and Mr. Brown's brushes with the law, focusing on two arrests for assaulting women. The personality trait that stands out is a fiercely defiant self-reliance. — Stephen Holden",4731,1

Ms. Christensen, in her meatiest role since &quot;Traffic,&quot;  and Ms. Phillips (from &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot;) dig deeply under the skins of their characters.

The mill arrives but the pension does not, and Sogo must don his uniform and pick up his gun, to head into town and demand his rights.

But, as energetically directed by Rajkumar Santoshi, it does add to the critical mass that lately has been building up around Bollywood filmmaking, suggesting that someday soon it may explode internationally the way the Hong Kong cinema did in the late 1980's. — Dave Kehr",4778,1

Ultimately, Yojiro Takita's film is satisfying on neither level, but not for lack of trying. The hero, Seimei (Mansai Normura), is an &quot;Onmyoji&quot; &#151; translated as &quot;ying-yang master&quot; &#151; a soothsayer attached to the court as a supernatural protector. With the help of a young swordsman, he defends the emperor against the designs of his evil chief magician, the cackling Doson (Hiroyuki Sanada).

Apart from some fleeting dialogue that covers Bundy's unhappy childhood, the director, Matthew Bright, doesn't waste too much time on psychological explanations, or even on simple curiosity. Like Anthony Hopkins's Hannibal Lecter, Bundy is presented as a sympathetic monster whose lack of remorse enables him to act out the impulses that — or so the theory goes, at least — the rest of us are too cowardly and conventional to own up to. As &quot;Ted Bundy&quot; plods from one graphically filmed killing to the next, it displays little more stylistic flair than a Sears catalog. — Dave Kehr",4828,1

"In spite of an exceptionally fine cast, this melodrama of suburban adolescent dysfunction never rises to the level of its literary ambitions. Leland (Ryan Gosling) is a sensitive young man who kills his ex-girlfriend's mentally handicapped brother, an event that becomes the center of a moody, unconvincing tableau of affluent misery. Don Cheadle plays an aspiring novelist who is Leland's teacher at the juvenile detention facility where he is awaiting trial, and he sees the young man's story as material for a book. The film, its soundtrack awash in self-pitying, guitar-strumming pop songs, combines the look and mood of television teen dramas (notably the late &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot;) with the solemn portentousness of second-rate &quot;serious&quot; fiction. — A.

"The story of two Sicilian brothers who immigrate to Turin in the late 1950's frames an evocative, somewhat  nostalgic portrait of Italy emerging out of postwar poverty. Giovanni (Enrico Lo Verso), an  illiterate laborer who worships education, is fiercely protective of his smart but shifty  younger brother Pietro (Francesco Guiffrida) whom he encourages to be a teacher. The elliptical  story of one brother's rise and the other's downfall and of their passionate but troubled  fraternal bond leaves many questions hanging, but it is powerfully acted and gorgeously  photographed. – Stephen Holden",4837,1

"This melodrama by the Mexican director Alejandro González Iñárritu is a ruminative, stunned look at life after death — that is, the existence of the living after they have been devastated by loss. It's the aftermath. The actors playing the characters who have been rocked by catastrophe don't sink to theatrical histrionics; instead they're linked by the red-eyed, unblinking stare of zombies, and they shamble through their day-by-day activities as if saddled with death wishes they are too enervated to act upon. This is American Existentialism. The stars achieve something that doesn't sound as if it's possible: a virtuosity in the depiction of people wasting away minute by minute. Be prepared for it. You won't come out unaffected, because the depths of intimacy that the director plumbs here are so rarely touched by filmmakers that &quot;21 Grams&quot; is tantamount to the discovery of a new country. Prof. Paul Rivers (Sean Penn) is suffering from a damaged heart, which is about to give out on him, and the transplant he receives so consumes him with guilt that he's like a death-row prisoner with a horrible secret who's been pardoned. He still believes he deserves to die. Cristina (Naomi Watts), a reformed party girl, has returned to her fallen ways after taking up with Paul. She's lost her family in an auto accident. And Jack (Benicio Del Toro) is a shaggy, trembling mountain of anger he can barely contain. His already tenuous grasp on sobriety is slipping away even faster since being involved in a terrible incident. Working with the screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga and the bewilderingly versatile cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto — the team he assembled for his debut feature, &quot;Amores Perros&quot; — Mr. González Iñárritu once again deals with three scenarios connected by one far-reaching cataclysm. It's too early to call it a crowning work of a career — this is only his second film — but it may well be the crowning work of this year. — Elvis Mitchell",4853,1

The teenage schoolgirl Kirie (Eriko Hatsune) lives in a small Japanese town that becomes stranger all the time. Saito (Ren Osugi), the father of her best friend, is obsessed with spirals: he has a room at his house devoted to spirals and spiral-influenced objects. Director Higuchinsky and his team capably deliver the swelling freakery; after Saito's death, the spiral madness explodes, its enveloping power spotlighted by a huge spiral cloud filling the skies and a single dark finger brushing the ground like a tornado. Then things really get weird, though not particularly scary: the movie is all portent and no content. — Elvis Mitchell",4857,1

"Unfolding as a bumpy, muddled &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; series of confusing, overcrowded tableaus, the new Cole Porter biography gives you the creepy sense of watching adult children (with the singular exception of Kevin Kline, who can surmount any disaster) dressed up in period costume at a school pageant. Although its publicity goes out of its way to pat the movie on the back for its supposed candor about Porter's homosexuality, the film's attitude toward sex is dainty. The heat in a film about the man who wrote &quot;Too Darn Hot&quot; remains a steady, air-conditioned 68 degrees. It can't imagine a wealthy, sophisticated couple marrying for friendship and social advantage without that arrangement involving torment and guilt over its lack of sex. Some two dozen Porter songs are glossed by contemporary singers like Elvis Costello (&quot;Let's Misbehave&quot;), Alanis Morissette (&quot;Let's Do It, Let's Fall in Love&quot;),  Sheryl Crow (&quot;Begin the Beguine&quot;) and Diana Krall (&quot;Just One of Those Things&quot;). If they're not awful, these labored, self-conscious interpretations are undercut by flimsy period arrangements. — Stephen Holden",4902,1

"When Ashton Kutcher got the news that this much-delayed bad-taste comedy that he stars in was actually being released, he must have felt as if he were being &quot;Punk'd.&quot; On that MTV video-prank series, Mr. Kutcher and a crew raise the temperature of music-video mainstays like Pink with hazing stunts intended to get their goats. Mr. Kutcher's goat has not only been got, it's roasting on a spit. Mr. Kutcher plays the amiable doormat Tom, who works in publishing and wants to move to the business's creative side . He attempts to ingratiate himself with his tyrannical boss,  Jack (Terence Stamp), who says whatever he thinks to whomever happens to be standing nearby. Most of his sentences tend to end with &quot;You're fired.&quot; And Tom has a crush on Jack's daughter, Lisa (Tara Reid), who persuades him to house-sit at the palatial, antique-filled estate she shares with her angry no-nonsense dad. Jack instructs Tom in caring for his home &#151; no guests, no shoes and no damage or it's no job. This muddled comedy of confusion feels as if it were a Farrelly brothers' comedy that has sat exposed to the elements long past its expiration date; perhaps that's why almost every joke is stale. It absently tosses humor about race, sex, injury, disease and the handicapped into the same garbage bag. Yet, the pile of refuse is so uninteresting even the flies stay away. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",4905,1

Maya Sansa and Regina Orioli portray a volatile lesbian  couple who flee the gas station where they operate with the dead body of the younger woman's  mother in their trunk after she dies in an accident that looks like a murder. In addition to having to dump the corpse, they are pursued by a sinister gang of two hoodlums and their moll. The Italian landscape through which they move is a sullen, oil-slicked wasteland of highways, gas stations and sleazy roadside clubs that resembles the American Southwest as portrayed in low-budget Hollywood thrillers. &#151; Stephen Holden",4921,1

If you haven't caught up with the live-action series — the brainchild of Lloyd Kaufman — imagine the zaniness of Mad magazine folded into the satire of &quot;South Park&quot; with the grotesquery exponentially multiplied into free-for-all farce. If the take-no-prisoners humor of &quot;Citizen Toxie&quot; is very funny, the movie's  relentless comic excess is ultimately a little exhausting.

"Robert De Niro plays Vincent LaMarca, a New York homicide detective who has fled the decaying resort town of Long Beach on Long Island to escape a broken marriage and a family history that includes a father who was executed for murder. But when Vincent's feckless, drug-addicted son (James Franco) is implicated in a murder, the policeman's stable, second-chance life threatens to collapse around him. Unfortunately, as it assumes the burden of a too-complicated plot, the movie starts to collapse as well. This somber crime melodrama is full of rich, dark themes of paternal guilt, professional duty and moral choice, but the director, Michael Caton-Jones, and the screenwriter, Ken Hixon, do little more than stuff them into the mouths of the characters. Frances McDormand and Mr. De Niro, who gives one of his deepest, most generous performances in some time, are undermined by a movie that seems not to trust their gifts for emotional understatement. — A.

"This loopy, luscious extravaganza of 50's-vintage couture and timeless French actresses aspires to be at once a camp artifact and an object of camp. It is at once a claustrophobic murder mystery, a musical, a serial cat-fight that makes Clare Booth Luce's &quot;Women&quot; look tame, and a parody of all of those things. François Ozon pays tribute to a cinematic tradition of   triumph and humiliation, conjuring Max Ophuls, Luis Bunuel, Rainier Werner Fassbinder and Douglas Sirk without slipping from his own elegant, rigorous  style. The members of the cast, playing a dysfunctional extended family  whose patriarch, the only man in the picture, has been murdered, strive to  outdo each other in glamour, pathos and ridiculousness.

"In the cardboard kingdom of Genovia, the setting for the new feature-length fairy tale &quot;The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement,&quot; the streets are as scrubbed of dirt and personality as a Disney theme park. A mythic European country where everyone speaks accented English by way of Britain, France and Brooklyn, Genovia is the adopted home of Princess Mia (Anne Hathaway), a one-time San Francisco teenager-turned-old-world pretender. Unlike Pinocchio, Mia doesn't hang her wish on just any star; she hangs it on the movie-made promise that every girl can find her inner princess and, like, you know, rule. Directed by Garry Marshall, who's been selling wish-fulfillment fantasies for years, most notably in &quot;Pretty Woman,&quot; and written by Shonda Rhimes, &quot;The Princess Diaries 2&quot; combines a classic storybook scenario, in which the former ugly duckling refines her swan standing, with the usual self-help uplift. This time around, the princess who would be queen learns what the rest of us know already: happy movie endings generally come to those women who eat their independence and, in time, a wedding cake too. — Manohla Dargis",5011,1

"This new adaptation of Mary Rodgers's beloved novel (also the source of a 1976 movie starring Jodie Foster) is a brisk, inventive comedy of generational misunderstanding and mother-daughter reconciliation. Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis are Anna and Tess Coleman, who wake up one morning to find that they have switched bodies. The mother must navigate the social minefield of high school, while the daughter is plunged into a frenzy of multi-tasking, juggling work, parenthood and an impending remarriage (to an upstanding fellow played by Mark Harmon). The measure of the film's integrity is how smoothly it modulates from wild farce to earnest sentiment, and the two — really the four — main performances are as dazzling as they are effortless. This is especially true of Ms. Curtis, a real-life mom (and best-selling children's-book author in her own right), whose impersonation of a teenager trapped in a middle-aged body is wild, witty and breathtakingly funny. — A.O.

Mr. Rose and Mr. Bell do fine jobs as the lovers, and Ms. Behr is convincingly arrogant and needy.",5077,1

"Jeff Blitz's first documentary feature, which follows eight participants in the 1999 National Spelling Bee, has enough suspense, humor and emotion to fill a season of Hollywood blockbusters. The children, whose various backgrounds form a rich, complex American patchwork, are as remarkable for their individuality as for their sociological diversity. Somehow the picture's themes — the peculiarity of the competitive spelling subculture, of its young adherents, and of the English language itself — add up to an unexpectedly rich and moving work of cultural insight and human sympathy. The movie is a celebration of intelligence, discipline and the irreducible oddness of American culture. — A. O. Scott",5097,1

"The most amazing thing about Sam Raimi's franchise-launching adaptation of the 40-year-old Marvel comic book is that its high-tech special effects are overshadowed by witty writing and inventive performances. Tobey Maguire rediscovers the smart, alienated adolescent underneath the superhero's mask, and mocks the heroic crime-fighter conceit without subverting it. Mr. Raimi and the screenwriter David Koepp are masters of pop realism, tossing off easy jokes and corny sentiment with gratifying enthusiasm. The romance between Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is as ripe as an old Hollywood melodrama, and a minor-key conclusion like something out of Henry James. The cold, thin computer-generated action sequences and a fatigued performance by Willem Dafoe dampen the fun a little, but Mr. Maguire, Ms. Dunst and J. K. Simmons, in an uproarious turn as the irascible tabloid editor J. Jonah Jameson, manage to save the day. — A. O. Scott",5099,1

Packed with crude  shocks, the movie has an ugly undertone of class warfare (Jennifer Lopez's battered wife is a  spunky working-class waitress who marries up).

When Suzanne's parents finally obtain a visa for her, the little girl is abruptly placed on an airplane and shipped off to the world of capitalism, convertibles and Elvis Presley. Instead of a stirring tribute to the land of opportunity, the picture is largely the story of a childhood interrupted, of an idyllic, natural youth replaced by something artificial and grotesque. - Dave Kehr",5133,1

"Joe Maggio's video feature is set in a halfway house in a dilapidated section of Brooklyn, though its screenplay, full of odd, yearning references to 1930's westerns, could just as well have taken place in Tombstone, Ariz. The title character, played with grace and gentility by Clint Jordan, is a strong, silent and hopelessly naïve Southerner who finds himself adrift in the frontier town of Williamsburg, where he falls for one of the local girls, Ruby (Kirsten Russell), a hard-bitten prostitute. The classic westerns often held out the possibility of redemption for their socially outcast heroes. That possibility does not exist for the more cynical Mr. Maggio, who sees Virgil and Ruby as trapped in a cycle of addiction and exploitation. It is enough of an act of optimism just to raise the specter of heroic nobility, something that &quot;Virgil Bliss&quot; accomplishes with subtlety and poignancy. — Dave Kehr",5153,1

Yosuke, unemployed and at loose ends, who is searching for a stolen Buddha hidden near a red bridge, has been handpicked by Fate to become a part of Saeko’s life. Mr. Imamura's fascination with the physical representation of emotion, particularly guilt, cuts a wide swath through his work, but the bridge in the title of this lurid and less than lucid work hobbles the film. — Elvis Mitchell",5156,1

It sounds complicated, and it is, especially when the made-over Liz attracts the attention of a shy local restaurant owner who is played by Tony Shalhoub, the director and Brooke Adams's husband. But the ramshackle intricacy of the story, which is full of genuine surprises and odd, improvised moments, highlights the movie's most appealing trait, which is the warm, sly individuality it confers on its odd, abrasive and marvelously likable characters. &#151; A.

This scene is a real crack-up, as is much of the first 20 minutes or so of &quot;Friday After Next,&quot; the latest in the &quot;Friday&quot; series.

"If there is anything to be gained from tugging Charles Dickens's 1839 novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; from its politically pointed setting in early industrial London and transplanting it to a subculture of sulky male hustlers in contemporary Toronto, it is not evident in this small, bland Canadian film written and directed by Jacob Tierney.  His update imagines Oliver as a blond, virginal teenager (Joshua Close) who has run away from a grim life in the provinces to the big city, where on his first night in town he is lucky enough to run into Dodge (Nick Stahl), a youthful prostitute who takes him back to the dormitory for lost boys operated by Fagin (Gary Farmer, the roly-poly Indian actor of Jim Jarmusch's &quot;Dead Man&quot;). The act of placing a larger-than-life literary figures in a constrained, narrowly naturalistic environment merely strips the characters of their scale and interest.

The movie strains to be a surrealist, knockabout satire about decency, which is a daring subject. (It takes place in a fantasy land similar to California, but it's not clear when.)

"This Argentine film proposes only a slight variation on a formula that, from &quot;Central Station&quot; to &quot;Kolya,&quot; has become all too familiar in the art houses:  the cute child who awakens the cranky grown-ups around him to the infinite possibilities of life.  This time it's a cross-eyed 9-year-old (Rodrigo Noya, a sort of South American Mason Reese) whose thick, black glasses sit heavily but adorably on his round face.  It is Buenos Aires in the 1960's, and Valentín is being raised by his lovably eccentric grandmother (played by the Spanish actress Carmen Maura), after the divorce of his parents.  Valentín no longer sees his mother, who was chased out of the family home by his imperious, fascist-leaning father (Alejandro Agresti, who also wrote and directed the film).  The father now drops by only for occasional visits to his ailing mother and neglected son, preferring to live the life of a carefree playboy.

In addition to its technical innovations, which test the limits of the human eye, ear and mind, the film boasts some brilliant improvisational acting from its enormous cast. Especially fine are Jean Tripplehorn and Stellan Skarsgard, whose strongly emotional performances add a measure of pathos. Whether ''Time Code'' will ultimately be seen as a bold prophecy of the dawning visual age or as a passionate, gimmicky curio is for the future to decide.

"This kung-fu comedy is real Swiftian comedy: not Jonathan Swift-type satire, but more along the lines of pork products from Swift and company. &quot;Soccer&quot; is fatty, chewy and funny and slightly gamy, given the amount of time the movie sat on the shelf. The fact is undeniable since the scoreboard for the climactic game between the Shaolin stalwarts and their principal foes, Team Evil, marks the year as 2003. Since the comedy and martial arts stuff is so timeless, the year might as well be 1983.  The Honk Kong action cynosure Steven Chow &#151; who also directed, and contributed to the ransom-note-assemblage of a script &#151;  plays Sing, a down-on-his-luck Shaolin disciple reduced to telling random passers-by that &quot;Kung-fu is a complete way of life.&quot; While denting brick walls with kicked rubbish, Sing is discovered by Fung. Years earlier, Fung was disabled by his teammate Hung (Patrick Tse), who now owns Team Evil. Eventually, Sing is reunited with his brothers, after Fung convinces them to use their kung-fu skills to play soccer. &quot;Soccer&quot; is so unabashed in its cheesiness that it could be spread on crackers. The movie is too much fun to take seriously, or ignore. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",5241,1

The good cheer of &quot;Love at Times Square&quot; is relentless, and given the film's 155-minute running time, occasionally oppressive.

After the bad guy's minions kill off Castle's entire extended family (with special attention to his wife and young son), Castle transforms himself into a ruthless, low-tech superhero, armed with guns, knives, military training and a portable fire hydrant.

"Tornadoes in Los Angeles. Hail in Tokyo. The entire northern hemisphere encased in a sheet of ice, with uncountable casualties, including life as we know it. All of which adds up, in the hands of Roland Emmerich, to a  sprawling, oddly light-hearted action picture. The computer-generated special effects are awesome, though not in the traditional sense of the word. As you watch cities obliterated by wind, water and ice, you don't think &quot;My God, how horrible&quot;; you think, &quot;cool!&quot; The only one who seems genuinely worried is Dennis Quaid, playing a scientist whose apocalyptic warnings are ignored until it's too late. He sets out to find his son (Jake Gyllenhaal), who is stranded at the New York Public Library and who seems, all in all, pretty relaxed. Like most disaster films, this one is ultimately more soothing than alarming, which may undermine its supposed ambition to raise awareness about the perils of climate change. — A. O. Scott",5315,1
"Fantastic bravado from a 27-year-old filmmaker who has laid-back wit, amazingly fluid camera technique and no qualms about borrowing from the best. Following the ''Nashville'' blueprint, Paul Thomas Anderson explores the quaint customs and inchoate longings within an insular pop subculture, this time the sleazy, druggy universe of 70's porn. From spectacular party sequences to clear proof that the party is over, this busy, wildly colorful film has no trouble holding interest -- far from it. But its extravagant length is a tactical mistake, since it promises bigger ideas than Mr. Anderson delivers. Mark Wahlberg gives a terrifically appealing performance in the story's tricky central role. Prominently featured in the fine ensemble cast are Burt Reynolds, doing his best and most suavely funny work in years as a porn auteur, and Julianne Moore as his ethereal, vaguely tragic star. Minor details, like her hilariously bad porn acting or the flashy period costumes, are an evil treat. — Janet Maslin",5316,1

Hired to investigate the disappearance of a university student, Jill is soon sucked into a snakepit of depravity and double-dealing. There is something charming about the movie's vision of poetry as a sleazy, glamourous pursuit, which it may well be in Australia. But Ms. Lang's flat, paceless direction and Annie Kennedy's painfully expository script (adapted from &quot;a novel in poetry&quot; by Dorothy Porter) makes the conceit seem preposterous. Instead of suspense, there is confusion; instead of intrigue, a lot of inexplicable confrontation among characters whose significance is not so much enigmatic as obscure. &#151; A. O. Scott",5345,1

"Mel Gibson's version of the last 12 hours in the life of Jesus, controversial long before it was seen, is a harrowingly violent spectacle that invites the audience's revulsion in the hopes that it will turn into something like awe. After a horror-movie beginning, complete with demons, menacing music and creepy camera moves, Mr. Gibson settles into a long, relentless contemplation of torture, maiming and execution. His stated goal was realism, but the emphatic musical, visual and aural effects — the first nail is driven into Jesus' palms with a sickening thwack that must have required hours of digital tweaking — make the film a melodramatic exercise in high-minded sadomasochism. Despite concerns about the anti-Semitism of Mr. Gibson's portrayal of the Pharisees, the movie is more grueling and unnerving than outrageous or offensive. For a movie made out of such evident religious conviction, it seems utterly lacking in grace. — A. O. Scott",5439,1

"This documentary is Nick Broomfield's second cinematic examination of Aileen Wuornos, the Florida serial killer and truck-stop prostitute who  murdered several of her clients and pleaded self-defense but was sentenced to death; she  was executed on Oct. 9, 2002. While the earlier film (in 1992) documented the cynical  marketing of her story, the new one follows her all the way to her execution and looks  into her troubled past. The film is absorbing partly because its clinically paranoid subject  exudes a scary charisma. But although its portrait of Wuornos is sympathetic and  becomes the basis for a screed against capital punishment, its arrival right on the heels of &quot;Monster,&quot;  in which Charlize Theron delivers an eerily accurate impersonation of Wuornos, smacks  of the very exploitation Mr. Broomfield so righteously condemns. — Stephen Holden",5467,1

And &quot;Win a Date With Tad Hamilton!,&quot; a sweet little nothing of a romantic comedy that has all the edge of an  overstuffed cream puff, is just the sort of innocuous vehicle that can carry an aspiring  princess another step closer to royal status. Ms. Bosworth's character is a star-struck  supermarket checker in a West Virginia hamlet who wins a date with her Hollywood  heartthrob (Josh Duhamel). He, in turn, is captivated by her wholesome innocence and  goodness and thinks she can reform him from his bad-boy ways.

"Hypnosis in the movies has always been synonymous with hocus-pocus, and the tradition continues in this flashy, mildly tingly British thriller. The elaborate story involves kidnappings, unsolved serial killings, second sight, church architecture, zodiac signs, Christian heresy, insomnia,  nightmares, potential medical malpractice, computer magic and the London police  department. This baggage proves way too heavy for the movie to make sense of. But the supernatural kidnapping drama can still be appreciated as an atmospherically volatile roller-coaster in which half-waking dreams increasingly erode reality. It all begins when Goran Visnjic, playing an anti-smoking hypnotherapist, is asked to unlock the traumas of a  catatonic little girl. — Stephen Holden",5664,1

"In adapting Alexandre Dumas's novel with a straight face – without noisy special effects or tired attempts at irony – the filmmakers have made a movie as full of old-fashioned pleasures as the book itself. Jim Caviezel has some old-fashioned matinee-idol dash, Guy Pearce is a deliciously hammy villain, and Luis Guzman and Richard Harris, as the hero's jailhouse guru and pirate sidekick, add an element of mischievous fun. Unabashedly corny, square and high-spirited, the movie revives a sense of grand, sweeping fun that has been missing from the bloated, cynical juvenile blockbusters of recent years. – A. O.

This movie certainly will fall short for those seeking loamy discourse  about the ramifications of Mr. Derrida's work; to these people it will seem like, well, a pop-song bowdlerization of a master's oeuvre. The directors know that Mr. Derrida  must  be introduced to neophytes, who will not  have a firm grasp of  deconstruction  until they see how it is woven into the fabric of the film. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",5669,1

If the playwright's dazzling language is intact, the embellishments interrupt its rhythms, and the low-keyed, realistic performances don't synchronize with the style of the play.

As their interwoven stories unfold, the five friends, who struggle to maintain their bond, increasingly resemble strays adrift in the port city Inchon in winter. They are no more able to take care of one another than they are of the cat. As the movie abruptly crosscuts among the five friends, it fails to lend the characters' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them. Too much information is withheld, and the narrative strands are developed haphazardly. — Stephen Holden",5726,1

Plenty of love floats among the Ullmans, but just as much bottled-up rage, despair and  guilt leaks out. Because the mother has to work as a nightshift midwife in a Haifa  hospital, her two rebellious oldest children, 17 and 16, are forced to take care of the  youngest two. One day, a small act of forgetfulness precipitates a grave new family crisis. — Stephen Holden",5735,1

"A life of crime is especially hard to leave behind if it is also the family business, as the title character learns in &quot;Sonny,&quot; Nicolas Cage's directing debut, set in the fragrant sexual demimonde of New Orleans in 1981. Of all the directors Mr. Cage has worked with, the one who seems to have most influenced his approach to filmmaking is Mike Figgis, who made  &quot;Leaving Las Vegas,&quot; for which Mr. Cage won an Oscar for best actor. Like Mr. Figgis, he shows more interest in the behavior of his characters than in their motivations, and tries to give his scenes an open-ended, improvised feeling. The problem, though, is that the movie feels aimless and awkward. Some moments have a creepy, sleazy intensity, but the whole thing is emotionally incoherent. &#151; A. O. Scott",5738,1

"Al Pacino as Eli Wurman, a high-powered New York publicist in the twilight of his career, is the sparkplug driving this satirical melodrama that never catches up with its star. This ambitious study of fame-mongering would like to think of itself as a descendant of &quot;Sweet Smell of Success,&quot; but it fails to find contemporary corollaries to the earlier film's super-charged language and  caffeine-fueled pace. It's further undermined by conceptual confusion. When not facetiously dropping names, the movie lumbers between a  clichéd bleeding-heart fable of lost 60's dreams and a half-baked thriller in which nasty  people in high places try to cover up a murder. Any one of those concepts might  have worked on its own, but forced together they don't allow one another to breathe. — Stephen Holden",5742,1

Reno has little use for hysterical knee-jerk flag-waving, and religious zealots of every stripe. At once feisty and funny and delivered with a noisy, pugilistic verve, the performance (filmed at the Club at La MaMa in the East Village three months after the terrorist attacks) should delight liberals and rankle conservatives. &#151; Stephen Holden",5745,1

If things weren't bad enough, enormous mutated spiders are chewing up Prosperity's remaining residents. &quot;Freaks&quot; is mercifully unpretentious, and whisks through its abbreviated running time.

"The opening credits of the atmospheric but flat &quot;Returner&quot; reveals that it's a Robot production, a far more telling piece of information than the filmmakers may have realized.  I'm not sure if this is a movie or a friendly corporate merger. &quot;Returner&quot; begins in the middle of a pitched battle, where the rag-covered Milly (Anne Suzuki) crouches to stay below the gunfire. She travels from the distant future &#151; 2084 &#151; to end up in the near past: 2002, the Japanese release date of the film. Her trip drops her right in the middle of another gun battle, a gang war between the cold-blooded Mizoguchi (Goro Kishitani), who shoots crying children to silence them, and the revenge-minded Miyamoto (Takeshi Kaneshiro).  Miyamoto's innate integrity is obvious, since he has the placid, slightly exaggerated good looks of an anime hero and hair so impeccably styled each strand must have been treated individually. He's essentially a gunslinging ronin, and Milly needs him to avert the future war. He's not easily convinced, despite her futuristic rags and magical powers. He probably figures if she can't do much to enliven the second-hand Xerox of a script, then the future's not worth much anyway. Takashi Yamazaki, who wrote the screenplay with Kenya Hirata, does a credible job of handling the hand-to-hand combat and spinning-in-mid-air gunplay. But the competent and lavishly produced martial sequences aren't nearly enough to compensate for a dead-on-its-feet story. &quot;Returner&quot; is a smorgasbord that seems to have been picked out of a dumpster. It clumsily combines a fish-out-of-water story with bits lifted from sources including the &quot;Terminator&quot; movies, &quot;Star Wars,&quot; &quot;Starman,&quot; &quot;Close Encounters,&quot; a couple of Pink Floyd albums and H. G. Wells. What seems to elude Mr. Yamazaki is that clever pilfering is a form of entertainment itself &#151; a pop-culture art. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",5799,1
"The gray clouds hang like a shroud over the small French resort town of Julie Lopes-Curval's melodrama. They remain in place for most of the 12 months of modest, vaguely stirring complications that roll past during the film. That is undoubtedly her aim; she has managed to create a world of people mired in their limitations and the petty jealousies of a town that stinks of no ambition. In this winner of the 2002 Camera D'Or from the Cannes Film Festival, Ms. Lopes-Curval and her co-writer Francois Favrat are out to depict the cramped, meaningless lives of a place that doesn't really exist after the summer is over; in effect, it's like being backstage at Brigadoon during the period when the magic is over.  Her achievement is so particularly — and peculiarly — realized, evoking the enforced parameters and rhythms of small-town life, that the movie itself begins to feels restrictive. Ms. Lopes-Curval has managed to create a world of trapped people, and after a while we feel stuck in that world of no imagination with them. While she portrays the brittleness of their lives with lovely splashes of generosity, the lack of condescension doesn't change the fact that there's not much drama to be found in those very limitations. Her characters don't do much beyond getting on each other's nerves. Eventually, &quot;Seaside&quot; itself begins to feel like a gambler plugging away at a one-armed bandit — and as everyone knows, the odds for pleasure in such a pursuit are not in your favor. — Elvis Mitchell",5800,1

It traces a hectic day in the life of a splintered Dominican family, whose pride and joy, Manny (Leo Minaya), is about to graduate from high school. Mr. Eason's ear for speech is as impressive as his eye for local detail, and the film manages to be at once intimate and tactful. Frankie G., who plays Manny's protective older brother, Junior, has some rough edges, but he shows himself to be a powerful actor with the ability to display the nuances of his character's contradictory temperament. In the end, the movie swerves toward melodrama — becoming a fable of The Streets rather than a story of particular blocks and boulevards — but for most of its packed, brief running time it is beautifully observed and full of life. — A.O. Scott",5814,1

"Ashton Kutcher, the shaggy haired young actor best known for &quot;Dude, Where's My Car?&quot; and dating Demi Moore, stars in a purported thriller that mines the memory loss theme that has been turning up with striking regularity in American movies, from &quot;Memento&quot; to &quot;Paycheck.&quot;  Mr. Kutcher's character, Evan Treborn, is an earnest college student whose life has been marked by a series of blackouts surrounding traumatic events.  Majoring in psychology (he keeps a rat maze in his dorm room), he hopes to discover the reason behind the mysterious black holes in his mind. For reasons the film does not trouble to explain, Evan discovers that, if he reads a few lines from his childhood journals, he will be projected back in time to his traumatic moments, where he will be able to change his behavior in small ways that will make a big difference later on.  The overly complicated plotting quickly becomes impossible to follow, while the filmmakers — the writer-directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber — wallow in some of the most repugnant imagery imaginable: a dog set aflame, a baby blown to bits. — Dave Kehr",5817,1

There, because of a clause in her will, he becomes director of the church choir that banished his mother for singing R&B and has done the same to his boyhood sweetheart, a sultry chanteuse named Lily (Beyoncé Knowles). The struggle between sacred and profane impulses is an old one in American popular music, and here it is given an interesting contemporary twist. This movie, lumpily directed by Jonathan Lynn, was produced by MTV Films, the filmmaking arm of a network not known for its piety. But &quot;The Fighting Temptations&quot; is thoroughly sanctified, presenting a carefully inoffensive story filled with inspirational performances by (in addition to Ms. Knowles), Shirley Caesar, Montel Jordan and, best of all, the O'Jays, who just happen to work at the local barbershop. — A.O.

Alexie allows himself to be put in charge of a socialist plot to rescue Sophie, a Russian woman (Svetlana Lunkina) being held in a French prison for the assassination of a Russian judge. His plan: hop the Petersburg-Cannes Express, a luxury train fashioned from lace curtains and dark wood paneling, and kidnap the Czar's interior minister (Andris Lielais) on his way to take charge of the prisoner. He is helped in this imaginative scheme by Anna (Ksenia Alpherova), a coldly doctrinaire socialist who, to the surprise of no one who has ever seen a movie, thaws when faced by Alexie's irresistible charm. — Dave Kehr",5875,1

"Bertrand Tavernier is not often thought of as a man of passion. His enthusiasms are evident from the subjects he chooses rather than their substance. But in &quot;Safe Conduct,&quot; the heat of the moment prevails. It cooks &quot;Conduct&quot; in a low, smoky and inviting sizzle. Heavy with incident and running nearly three hours, &quot;Conduct&quot; follows the attempts of the French film industry to stay alive during the Nazi occupation. The characters are constantly asking questions about the nature of art: whether it deserves to continue through such a time and how fine is the line between ambition and opportunism? Mr. Tavernier stages the movie like a dance marathon, intelligently shifting the pace and scale of the drama. The movie is full of juices that give it a healthy, pungent flow. — Elvis Mitchell",5898,1
"When it is not scaring you silly, this film invites you to reflect seriously on the fragility of modern civilization, which has been swept away, while the hero lies peacefully in a coma, by a gruesome and highly contagious virus. Four weeks after a laboratory full of rage-infected monkeys has been liberated by some tragically misguided animal-rights activists, the whole of London — and possibly every place else — has been substantially depopulated, leaving the few healthy survivors to contend with red-eyed, ravenous infecteds. The movie is suitably graphic and terrifying, but it also has some surprising pastoral moments, as the main characters flee London for the countryside. Anthony Dod Mantle's digital cinematography has an exquisite, painterly beauty that makes the picture not just scary, which it surely is, but genuinely haunting. In contemplating the extinction of the human race, Danny Boyle, director of such cynical, style-charged movies as &quot;Trainspotting&quot; and &quot;Shallow Grave,&quot; seems to have discovered his inner humanist. — A.

Mr. Smith again shows off a rare gift for fusing his comic-book sensibility with serious debates and big, big laughs, even if some parts of his film (Ms. Fiorentino's performance, Chris Rock's and semi-repartee from the ubiquitous Jay and Silent Bob) work better than others (an excrement monster). Making a gutsy leap into matters of faith, Mr. Smith miraculously emerges with his humor intact and his wings unsinged. — Janet Maslin",5905,1

"This drab comic melodrama  may lead to the creation of a new axiom: Success has many fathers, but failure has &quot;Project Greenlight.&quot;  This film is the latest result of the HBO series in which competitors win a chance to make a low budget movie, financed by Miramax, with the condition that their behind-the-scenes travails will be filmed for a making-of television series detailing the squalling and squabbling.  &quot;Heights&quot; isn't nearly as earnest and undercooked as last year's winner, the disastrous &quot;Stolen Summer.&quot; But &quot;Heights&quot; is another bleached Xerox, a coming-of-age nugget that's set in the Midwest. This time, the locale is Shaker Heights, Ohio, a Cleveland enclave that's the home of Kelly Ernswiler (Shia LaBeouf). Kelly is a bright teenager obsessed with historical American battles and a participant in war re-creations. He meets Bart (Elden Henson) after saving his life in a mock World War I battle and the two teenagers become fast pals. Kelly develops a relationship with Bart's parents and, more important, a crush on Bart's engaged older sister, Tabby (Amy Smart). Things are complicated at Kelly's house, too.  His mother (Kathleen Quinlan) employs a group of immigrants to make paintings that support the household. And his recovering addict father (William Sadler) treats their place as crash pad for the homeless and other less fortunates. Yes, Kelly's sitting on a pile of rage. It's why he spouts the kind of precocious drivel that, in real life, would get him beaten up by even the victims of bullies. The dewy, likable Mr. LaBeouf is facing more than simulated death on &quot;Heights.&quot; Even his off-center boy-toy equipment — his cranky line delivery, an addled timing that makes him sound as if was roused from a particularly good daydream, and a bedhead white-boy Afro — can't supply enough charm to keep this wobbly, wisecracking tearjerker alive. — Elvis Mitchell",5928,1
"The scruffy, tenderly funny story of a fledgling rock band from Raleigh, N.C., made with more finesse than its low budget or laid-back atmosphere might suggest. John Schultz brings a fond, knowing perspective to the world of the garage band, but his previous experience making promotional documentaries about Steven Spielberg movies also shows. Sweet and rueful, with a fresh, likable cast, solid comic timing and a chatty tone that owes much to Richard Linklater and Kevin Smith. Matthew Hennessey, as the group's drummer, shows off a slacker's gift of gab, while Kevin Corrigan plays a more stoned, seasoned rocker with a body that goes fishing, a mind ''somewhere between the tangerine trees and the marmalade skies.'' This breezy independent film places as high a value on spontaneity and freedom as its characters do. A laid-back good time. — Janet Maslin",5929,1

The issues the film raises — how to deal with a bully (Josh Peck), how to reason with unreasonable peers, how to behave in the wake of disaster — are staples of young-adult fiction. If not for the MPAA rating system, which gives honest movies like this one R ratings for depicting drug use and profanity, &quot;Mean Creek&quot; might have found an appreciative audience of thoughtful adolescents. Its cast of thoughtful adolescents is uniformly superb — Rory Culkin, Trevor Morgan and Carly Schroeder, who bear the ethical burden of the story, are especially fine. A predictable  turn toward melodrama halfway through mars the film's quiet, haunting naturalism, but it is an auspicious beginning for a serious and gifted filmmaker. — A. O. Scott",5984,1

Alison Lohman's equally impressive portrayal of the daughter, herself a talented artist, maintains a  perfectly calibrated balance between resentment and adoration.

"I'm not sure you could do much better in terms of high concept than the premise that this action comedy presents. The movie pits an elderly Elvis Presley and J.F.K., who's now an old African-American, against a mummy who shambles around a retirement home sucking the souls out of victims in a manner that probably explains why the picture got an R rating. The writer-director Don Corsarelli, faithfully working from a short story by Joe R. Lansdale, is moored in confines as limiting as the wheelchair the King uses to get around and a budget as starved of cash as Presley's movies were of imagination. The picture has a grungy high-spirit for its first third, and dissipates like a mist from an aerosol can by that point. When it requires that extra charge of magic or technique to lift it, the picture stalls out; finally, it's neither scary enough nor funny enough &#151; tramps like this, baby, they were born to be rented.  What fission the movie generates comes from its lead performers, including Ossie Davis's mocking, salted gravitas in playing J.F.K. &#151; here, he surgically went black and can't go back after the assassination attempt on his life.   Both of these living legends &#151; they're alive in this film, anyway &#151; are right out of the battle-ready episode of &quot;The Golden Girls.&quot; The movie is often enlivened by a cranky, wheels-off performance by Bruce Campbell as the King. Yet, &quot;Bubba H0-Tep&quot; falls back on the antic, self-consciously jokiness of a Mad magazine movie parody &#151; despite Mr. Campbell's performance, the movie winks at its pop-historical perspective so often it starts to feel like a twitch. By the time  it winds down, you feel like someone has opened Pandora's Box and found that its menacing contents had gone stale. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",6001,1

"In this genial, unchallenging ethnic sports comedy, Jess (Parminder Nagra) is a talented and passionate soccer player, whose Indian immigrant parents living in a suburb of London disapprove of her athleticism. The central drama is hardly new — the film is something between a Punjabi &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; and &quot;My Big Fat Sikh Wedding&quot; — but the compulsive proliferation of subplots makes it much longer and sloppier than it should be. Still, the cast is good-humored and appealing, especially the diminutive Ms. Nagra, who steers through a predictable series of obstacles with fierce, pouty determination. — A. O. Scott",6004,1

"Filmmakers looking to master the no-budget digital video film need look no further than &quot;Personal Velocity,&quot; where Ellen Kuras's cinematography wields delicacy and freshness. Ms. Kuras understands first and foremost that there's no point in trying to pretend that digital video is the same as film. Instead she uses the strengths of digital and wisely chooses to go smaller; she shoots the picture as if it were hand-painted, an intimacy that complements the writer and director Rebecca Miller's script and handling of her actors. The cumulative effect is that of watching misspent lives disintegrate before your eyes. Her canny accomplishment is a triumph, taking what could be dismissed as women's-picture material and giving it weight and heart. This is one of the finest pictures of the year because Ms. Miller's knowledge of her characters' insides is mirrored by the secure palette of Ms. Kuras's camera work. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",6046,1

"Quentin Tarantino's fourth movie, his first in six years, is astonishingly violent, intermittently fascinating and sometimes tedious. This may be the picture's most serious flaw, since it comes from a man whose worship of action movies from all over the world (but especially Asia) is evident in every frame. Also evident is his obsession with Uma Thurman: by far the most emotionally charged relationship in the movie is the one between the director and his star, who functions as his muse, idol, alter ego and fetish object. Her character, the Bride, is a former assassin whose former lover (that would be Bill) tried to kill her on her wedding day. In this film, the first installment in a two-part revenge epic, the Bride wakes up from a 4-year coma and goes after the hired swords and guns who attacked her. Most of the exposition has been left for Volume Two; this one is an anthology of increasingly violent sequences, some sickening, some rather thrilling, that culminates in a Tokyo nightclub bloodbath  during which Lucy Liu, playing a petite yakuza boss, shows off her Japanese, and also (quite literally) her brains. — A.

Despite his loneliness and isolation, Noi is part of an international tribe of hollow-cheeked, disaffected young people who populate movie screens from California to Argentina to Japan. He has trouble in school and with his father and grandmother, and  seeks refuge in a romance with Iris, who works in the local gas station/convenience store. Mr. Kari directs this spare, funny-sad story in a witty minimalist style, but after a while, like its protagonist, the film starts  to spin its wheels. Having no particular place to go, it ends with a   cataclysm that seems unduly portentous, gesturing toward a metaphysical   significance that it has not quite earned. &#151; A. O. Scott",6087,1

And so they find themselves in the desolate seaside town of Stonehaven, whose crumbling high-rise hotels and shuttered amusements have been converted into a &quot;designated holding area&quot; for illegal immigrants. The thoughtful stylishness of Pawlikowski's direction doesn't cheapen or aestheticize Tanya's plight but rather extends to her the dignity and compassion that only art can confer. — A. O.

Apart from a few token women in the chorus, the boys dominate the performance with cutting, slashing, robotic moves that evoke both Chinese martial arts films and Michael Jackson's undying &quot;moonwalk&quot; move.  The presentation is aggressive and confrontational, and the dancers perform without ever breaking their scowling, angry street faces.  The thin plot revolves around the bust up of best friends Elgin (Marques Houston, of the hip-hop group IMx) and David (Omari Grandberry of B2K) over David's determination to date Elgin's dazzling kid sister Liyah (Jennifer Freeman).

The news that Dre is going to be married to Reese (Nicole Ari Parker), a successful lawyer who happens to be stunningly beautiful, sends Sidney into a subconscious tizzy.

When his widowed father, Eddie (Tomas Milian), is shot during an  attempted robbery in the neighborhood bodega he owns, the characters, who include the  Ramirezes' Irish-American neighbors, face painful choices. Although the untidy movie juggles too many subplots to do them all justice, it teems with life. — Stephen Holden",6191,1
"Sam (Sean Penn), a mentally disabled man who must fight for custody of his young daughter, is aided by a tightly wound lawyer (Michelle Pfeiffer) who, in the course of discovering her client's essential humanity, discovers her own as well. The movie is a patchwork of tearjerker cliches, a number of which work quite effectively because Mr. Penn's performance goes deeper than the spastic mugging this kind of role usually invites. At bottom, though, it is an exercise in self-congratulation in which the audience is encouraged to participate, and even as the filmmakers preach the dignity of the disabled, they are not above exploiting Sam and his friends for cheap comical effect. – A. O. Scott",6192,1

"Fernando Trueba's wonderful documentary tribute to Latin jazz is a pure expression of the director's love for the music, a love so infectious it should leave you elated. The picture is bound to draw comparisons to &quot;The Buena Vista Social Club,&quot; but it is closer in spirit to &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; in that it mounts a respectful staging of the songs by its performers with an ease and classiness not lavished on jazz since the black-and-white jazz shorts of the 1930's and 40's. That was probably the last time jazz musicians have been treated as well by the medium. -- Elvis Mitchell",6202,1

Even though this sequel ticks off all the conventions, the movie dashes like a one-track-mind raptor.

"This exquisitely drawn animated feature is an intoxicating, sometimes baffling exercise in unabashed movie love. In this case the immediate object is Chiyoko Fujihara, a legendary (and fictitious) Japanese movie star whose retirement is interrupted by an ardent documentary maker. Chiyoko's reminiscences of her adventures on and off screen before and after World War II become a fantastic, gorgeously romantic voyage through the history of Japanese cinema in its golden age. Satoshi Koh pays tribute to the samurai epics, Godzilla movies and domestic urban dramas that were so central to that history, and he uses the freedom of animation to construct a seamless dream world in which real life and its representation in movies blend together in a single sweeping, intricate story. To some extent, the movie depends on familiarity with the cinematic and cultural traditions it celebrates, but its central emotions — the longing, worshipful fascination that the great vanished stars inspired in their fans — will be immediately accessible to anyone who has ever been seduced by the idea that life on screen can be not just more beautiful than real life, but more real. — A.

"Mainstays of independent animation for half a century, John and Faith Hubley are no longer with us (John died in 1977; Faith in 2001), but their presence continues to be felt through an ongoing series of retrospectives and tributes, of which this documentary, directed by Sybil DelGaudio, is the latest.  The film isfar more a celebration of the Hubleyss work (and marriage) than a critical examination of it, stringing together interviews with the Hubleys culled from various archival sources and extensive clips from their films, including the Oscar-winning Moonbird of 1959.  With testimony from animation historians Charles Solomon and John Canemaker, the case is made that the Hubleys were among the first to liberate animation from pigs and bunnies, as John characterized the subject matter of studio cartoons, and introduce weighty themes such as overpopulation and the nuclear menace.  Though not a technically polished production, Independent Spirits stands as an effective and affectionate introduction to a pair of sympathetic and dedicated artists. — Dave Kehr",6243,1

"It may sound odd to call a chilly paranoid thriller entertainment comfort food. But in the wake of 9/11, this globetrotting post-cold war melodrama full of standard cloak-and-dagger intrigue has the reassuring aroma of a home-cooked meal. There are no jihads or terrorists in sight and no apocalyptic scenarios, only dirty little secrets, as spies, counterspies from Russia and America tangle in a grubby story involving oil, sold secrets, murders and cover-ups. In this sequel to &quot;The Bourne Identity,&quot; many of the major hands who created the first film have returned, including Matt Damon as Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), the C.I.A.-trained assassin who can't remember his name or exactly why he's being hunted by everybody. As before, he spends almost the entire movie on the run. The movie reminds you that rhythms of film editing and collage making have allowed Hollywood to make the chase movie a surefire format. Plot and character ultimately don't matter much in a movie that's all about building and sustaining a mood in which visceral and emotional rhythms are blended into a high-gloss thrill ride. — Stephen Holden",6256,1

His infatuation leads him to a selfless, mature recognition of other people and the world around him. Mr. Majidi is not afraid of bold emotions, and his eye for color and composition finds amazing beauty in a harsh, austere world. – A. O. Scott",6257,1
"&quot;Space Station 3-D,&quot; the latest film to be photographed for the giant-screen Imax process in three dimensions, is apparently narrated by Tom Cruise.  At least, that's what the credits say, though the images are so overwhelming that it's hard for a viewer to recollect very much of what Mr. Cruise says or how he says it. As a medium, the 65-millimeter Imax process achieves a dazzling sharpness and scale that suggest what the thrill of the first Lumière and Edison films must have been like But the process, particularly in its 3-D extension, remains resolutely about itself. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing. Without the depth technology, &quot;Space Station 3-D,&quot; which opens today at Imax theaters nationwide, would be little more than an old-fashioned educational film. &#151; Dave Kehr",6258,1

"Who knows how many desperately poor rural folk have undertaken a journey similar to the one made by the Brazilian family of seven in Vicente Amorim's film &quot;The Middle of the World&quot;? The sketchy, picturesque film follows the exhausting 2,000-mile trip of Romão (Wagner Moura) and Rose (Cláudia Abreu), a handsome couple, and their five children from the state of Paraiba in northeastern Brazil to Rio de Janeiro. Romão, an unemployed truck driver, has set his sights on an unrealistically high monthly salary that he imagines he can earn in the big city. What distinguishes the family's odyssey is that the trip, consuming several months, is made on four bicycles. Journeying into the unknown, the family fends for itself, taking odd jobs in this or that town, sleeping outdoors and begging for food when necessary. The movie wants to be both a realistic family drama and a mythical odyssey but lacks the substance to be much more than a vignette. — Stephen Holden",6260,1

When one transgendered individual announces that she/he's a &quot;little embarrassed about doing this on camera,&quot; and then goes right ahead and does something in explicit close-up that, it seems safe to say, has never before been depicted in an above-ground movie, it's hard not to chuckle &#151; and hard, too, not to marvel at the many varieties of human experience. &#151; Dave Kehr",6268,1

Cédric Klapisch directs with more energy than polish, but his ragged, exuberant style is well suited to his characters, who are, like the movie itself, both appealing and shallow.

"Robert Parigi shows a kicky sense of humor in this low-budget film, and ably creates a smirking menace. The loner Kenneth (Desmond Harrington), who labors as a technical writer in Los Angeles decides to order an inanimate physical companion, an anatomically correct doll that he names Nikki. Kenneth, as slender as a riding crop, throws himself into his relationship with Nikki with loving devotion; it's a stand-in for a close encounter with Lisa (Melissa Sagemiller), who works in the same office that he does. Having Nikki around the house for his reindeer games helps Kenneth to open up, and gives him the nerve to ask Lisa out. When he gets to know her, Nikki starts to strike out in jealousy &#151; or does she? &#151; and Kenneth's natural discomfort level redlines. Mr. Parigi keeps a chill in the meager proceedings. One of the most disturbing elements of the movie comes from the fact that Nikki looks like an extravagant line item in the &quot;Love Object&quot; budget. You get the sense that the unliving doll has to be returned to a warehouse with as few scuffs as, um, humanly possible. The modestly assembled film is only periodically derailed because of its tone; the writer/director sometimes overplays the humor in the midst of all the deadpan. Occasionally, the movie seems to be parodying itself &#151; a danger of slim-budget affairs where we can almost see a meter ticking away the dollars, and you feel you've spent almost as much on admission as the filmmaker did completing the project. Understandably, Mr. Parigi wants to exercise some control &#151; besides striking a spark by pinching pennies &#151; and the comedy allows him to maintain a knowing pitch, just enough to keep &quot;Love Object&quot; brisk. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",6295,1

More than a scary close-up look at the raw mechanics of a right-wing coup which took place in April, 2002, the film is a cautionary examination of the use of television to deceive and manipulate the public. The coup lasted 48 hours, until a popular uprising forced the government out of office.

But over most of the Sardinia's beautiful,  rugged landscape, life goes on pretty much as it always has, and most the characters seem  barely cognizant of creeping globalization.  Consisting of four, loosely connected vignettes, each set in a different season, &quot;Three  Step Dancing&quot; parachutes you in to this world and demands that you to fend for yourself.  At its most absorbing, the movie has the pace and patient, nonjudgmental gaze of a Taviani Brothers epic that slows time and observes the procession of life without comment. — Stephen Holden",6323,1

At the heart of the film are riveting performances by David Morse as the coach, Gideon Ferguson, and Ryan Gosling as Roy Chutney, the high school quarterback he recruits for a regional six-man football team.

Used to being the center of attention, with her swirling outfits, honey blond hair and flair for self-dramatization (she dreams of becoming an actress), Lola is astonished to find herself the odd girl out at her new school, dominated by uptight preppies led by the imperious Carla (Megan Fox).  &quot;Confessions&quot; was directed by the British filmmaker Sara Sugarman (&quot;Very Annie Mary&quot;), which may explain why its New Jersey looks more like Beverly Hills than North Caldwell, and seems to function on a similar cultural basis, grounded in conspicuous consumption and the pursuit of celebrity (of course, it's also the kind of New Jersey you reach by taking a train from Grand Central). &#151; Dave Kehr",6359,1
"Early and late, in a starship chase sequence and in a light-saber duel between Yoda and the nefarious Count Dooku (Chirstopher Lee), some of the old &quot;Star Wars&quot; magic returns. But otherwise, the mixture of grandeur and whimsy that made the first three movies so thrilling has been sacrificed to self-importance, an incomprehensible plot and some of the worst screen acting of the year. Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman are dreadful as  Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala, who are reunited (and fall in love) in the midst of a messy political crisis that threatens the stability of the republic and the power of the Jedi order. Millions of people will see this dreary, joyless picture, but only those pursuing advanced degrees in &quot;Star Wars&quot;-ology will be able to appreciate it. — A. O. Scott",6360,1

Katharine and Rick are among three couples whose uncertain love lives the movie follows over a crucial two-month period between Halloween and New Year's Eve. As a whole the movie, directed by Linda Yellen from a screenplay by Gisela Bernice, might be described as a muddy, cliché-ridden sudsfest that lurches uncertainly between comedy and soap opera without ever finding its emotional or visual footing. – Stephen Holden",6367,1

They are two doctors and a physician's assistant who perform abortions in parts of the country where to do so is to attract physically and verbally aggressive protesters, fire-bombers and even assassins. While much of the film seems amateurishly shot, it has been edited into a highly professional presentation, one that smoothly intertwines the three stories and builds to an emotionally satisfying conclusion. — Dave Kehr",6377,1
"The unsettling rhythms of Paul Bettany, David Thewlis and Malcolm McDowell help place this crisp, tart and often infuriating crime film squarely in the tradition of British noirs. &quot;Gangster No. 1&quot; is &quot;All About Eve&quot; with shoulder holsters, and a crucial twist. Young Gangster's (Mr. Bettany) is coveting everything his boss, Freddy (Mr. Thewlis), controls, apparently because he knows he's second-rate; his aspiration to be the real thing is the motor that keeps him going. And the psychological underpinnings give this picture a charged emotional atmosphere. Most of the film takes place in 1968, with a flashback showing Freddy's curdled ease and ascension to the top of charts and Gangster's hissing hunger. Director Paul McGuigan, abetted by a melancholy John Dankworth score rich enough to function as another character, builds a clammy, claustrophobic atmosphere. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",6378,1

"Jeroen Krabb's earnestly schmaltzy film is so intent on pushing its virtuous agenda that its characters often sound like mouthpieces parroting predigested attitudes in a debate whose uplifting outcome is a foregone conclusion. That agenda has to do with Jewish identity and self-acceptance and facing one's memories of Nazi camps rather than burying them under a facade of homey sweetness and light. Although the movie has some genuinely touching moments and several strong performances, its screenplay by Edwin de Vries veers unsteadily between ham-fisted exposition and cloying sentimentality. -- Stephen Holden",6434,1

"The third installment of the comedy franchise whose jokes derive largely from references to recent hit films has been given a shot of adrenaline by David Zucker, who pioneered the genre with &quot;Airplane,&quot; and who has taken over the creative reins from the Wayans brothers. Most of the spoofing is at the expense of movies like  &quot;Signs,&quot; &quot;The Ring&quot; and the first two &quot;Matrix&quot; movies. The funniest sequence in a comedy that revels in knockabout farce and has the attention span of a hyperactive child  is a strenuous group effort to revive a corpse, first through some alarmingly aggressive  artificial respiration, then through slapping and slamming the body until it breaks apart.  Think of &quot;Scary Movie 3&quot; as an accelerated junk culture vaudeville with a Mad Magazine sensibility. — Stephen Holden",6438,1

"Stephen Fry, a noted actor and sometime novelist, makes his directing debut with this adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's &quot;Vile Bodies,&quot; considered by many to be the funniest novel ever written in English. The movie honors its source with vigor and gusto, capturing both Waugh's cheeky humor and his dark, stringent moralism. Stephen Campbell Moore and Emily Mortimer are touching and funny as the central couple, an impecunious aristocrat named Adam Symes and his long-term fiancée, Nina, but the picture is brought to life by its large supporting cast of both well-known and unknown British actors (and one Canadian, Dan Ackroyd, playing a blustering press baron). The chaotic plot follows a gaggle of twittering, gilded youth through the cynical, gossip-ridden social whirl of pre-World War II Britain. The parallels with the present are obvious without being overdone, and Mr. Fry's exuberant, occasionally messy film departs from the usual stuffy conventions of costume drama. — A. O. Scott",6442,1

As Hitler's armies approach, the film's candy colors fade into stark greens and grays. Little by little, the freedoms of the Silbersteins are taken away. Not much new ground is broken in &quot;All My Loved Ones.&quot; Almost every element of the film seems to come from an earlier Holocaust drama. Yet the material continues to carry its inherent emotional power and moral importance. As banal as the telling may be — and at times, &quot;All My Loved Ones&quot; more than flirts with kitsch — the tale commands attention. — Dave Kehr",6447,1

It employs the creatures that ominously lurk inside closets and give children the frights. In Monstropolis, the freakazoid parallel dimension in which the monsters live, children's screams are used as a power source. But any artifact from the human world is a contaminant, so when a 3-year-old girl enters Monstropolis, panic erupts and it's up to two monsters, Sully (John Goodman) and Mike (Billy Crystal), to return her without being blamed for the mishap. There hasn't been a film in years to use creative energy as efficiently as &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;; this is one clean-burning engine that doesn't waste a joke or a thought. – Elvis Mitchell",6450,1

At least all the explosions will drown out the ear-splitting score and the mind-numbing dialogue. And, it should be said, the aerial combat sequences are vivid and impressive. But rarely has a movie so technically proficient been so conceptually bankrupt. Kate Beckinsale, Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett -- playing two American pilots and a nurse embroiled in a nonsensical love triangle -- do what they can with the thudding, expository script, but the film, for all its bloat and bombast, can barely manage a single moment of genuine feeling.

Mr. Chabrol's  droll assault on  petit-bourgeois security feels like a satire of &quot;Ordinary People&quot; directed by Alfred Hitchcock.

"&quot;Love in the Time of Money&quot; consists of nine linked vignettes about lonely New Yorkers trying, and mostly failing, to connect with one another emotionally and sexually. The movie's governing notion is that this plot structure, a daisy chain of awkward encounters, is a metaphor for the loneliness and dislocation of modern urban life. This is hardly a new idea, though it's not necessarily a bad one. This movie, the first feature film written and directed by Peter Mattei, is a reworking of &quot;Reigen,&quot; Arthur Schnitzler's once scandalous 1897 play. Better known as &quot;La Ronde,&quot; the play has also inspired movies by Max Ophuls and Roger Vadim and the musical &quot;Hello Again.&quot; Mr. Mattei's version, in spite of good performances, is a listless and desultory affair. &#151; A.

"An idiotic college comedy not to be confused with Richard Linklater's 1991 film &quot;Slacker.&quot; The movie tells the story of three college buddies — Dave (Devon Sawa), Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael C. Maronna) — who have cheated their way through school by carrying off elaborate scams. With graduation only 48 days away, they plan one last scheme, which involves Sam's faking an accidental injury to take an exam a day late, by which time he has gotten all the answers from a stolen blue book. – Stephen Holden",6543,1

"&quot;Hart's War&quot; appears to be another of the Greatest Generation action dramas, coming on the heels of last year's botched &quot;Pearl Harbor.&quot; But &quot;War&quot; wants to be much more than pitched battles and casualties rendered with up-to-the-minute technology depicting violence. There are, of course, a few obligatory episodes of big-budget brutality wedged into this unwieldy crunch of social melodrama and P.O.W. action movie.  But rather than creating dramatic tension or irony, the contrasts combine to result in the oddest thing — a movie that wants to be everything and adds up to nothing. &quot;War&quot; is a film that tries to excel on several levels and falls flat on all of them. – Elvis Mitchell",6587,1

"The Norwegian writer and director Bent Hamer's wry, uninflected deadpan social comedy points as straight and true as a compass fixed on magnetic north. It has the tingly, dry shock of a snootful of sub-zero air. The material itself is so minimal that it makes a New Yorker cartoon look like an episode of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants.&quot; Folke (Tomas Norstrom) is an expert from the Swedish Home Research, part of a project to track the domestic habits of Norwegian bachelors. He moves into the home of one of the study's subjects, Isak (Joachim Calmeyer), a bizarre codger who pads around his tiny, uncomfortable house. Isak turns the tables at night by slipping into his attic and spying on the lonely Folke, who lives in a trailer on Isak's property. Mr. Hamer takes what sounds like a constricted and unpromising premise, and gets the most out of the modest contradictions. He maximizes the concept, through an entrancing visual flair and, eventually, a tiny depth of feeling. He keeps the film compact, and the design scheme of this postwar era has dash and vigor. The retro polish of &quot;Kitchen Stories&quot; comments on the loneliness of utilitarian design. Folke might as well be a vowel floating in a Campbell Soup can. — Elvis Mitchell",6595,1

Shot in digital video with non-professional actors, it has a harsh immediacy that forces you to confront the terrible plight of the world's displaced people one face at a time. But this story of peril, frustration and heartbreak also has moments of great warmth and vitality. Jamal (Jamal Udin Torabi), the younger of the two travelers, has a tough, impish joie de vivre, and as he and his cousin make their way west, they encounter decency as well as indifference. This movie has the paradoxical effect of forcing you to confront the enormity of the world's cruelty and the overwhelming scale of its suffering, and at the same time making you feel glad to be in it. — A.O.

It is a movie of few words, but even those loosely scattered phrases sound garbled, vague and fraught with a bogus allegorical weight. The sloppiness is deliberate. The semi-improvised screenplay was concocted as the movie was being filmed by Mr. Van Sant and his  stars, Matt Damon and Casey Affleck, who portray the unlucky hikers. With all its quirks, &quot;Gerry&quot; seeps into your pores like the wind-whipped sand that stings the faces of these disoriented hikers. — Stephen Holden",6614,1

"This almost unbearably powerful documentary assembles the work of more than two dozen filmmakers, some professional directors and videographers, some amateurs with cameras. Because the film is limited in space and time,  it presents a strictly street-level view of life (and death) in and around Lower Manhattan from the moment of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks until the following Tuesday. It recreates what those days felt like with excruciating precision: the wild panic, the moments of funereal calm, the spontaneous blossoming of solidarity and fellow feeling. Precisely because of its unsparing naturalism, the film's undercurrent of hope is more persuasive than the therapeutic formulas that define so much of &quot;Sept. 11.&quot; The lesson of those days, apparent even then, was that New York's civic fabric, as someone in &quot;Seven Days&quot; remarks, was stronger than anybody expected. &#151; A.

For a movie concerned with suicide, depression, terminal illness and bereavement, Lone Scherfig's dark comedy  is curiously uplifting, and dryly funny when it could be gooily sentimental. Wilbur and his brother Harbour, who runs the family bookshop, anchor the story with their contrasting temperaments, but its fluttery, eccentric heart belongs to Shirley Henderson, who plays a bookshop customer who joins their morose and peculiar family. — A.

The villains are the greedy folks at Microsoft, whose Windows operating system at one point threatened to monopolize the software industry. Although the film does its best to talk in nontechnical language, it's still fairly dense going. It compresses two decades of computer industry history into a straightforward if jargon-reliant account narrated by Susan Egan. – Stephen Holden",6678,1

In this desolate environment romance has flowered  between Yossi (Chad Knoller) and Jagger (Yehuda Levi) soldiers carrying on a discreet,  conflict-ridden love affair. The tensions at the base intensify with the arrival of two  female soldiers, one of whom fancies herself in love with Jagger. If the situation has all  the ingredients for a shrill, tearful melodrama, the taut screenplay by Avner Bernheimer  keeps the lid on: A subtle and superbly realized miniature. — Stephen Holden",6679,1

The film jets around the world to look at what Mr. Corcuera regards as prime examples of social injustice: a child laborer in Peru, an exiled Kurdish activist in Sweden and a man who has been on Death Row in Texas since 1986. As the filmmakers build up their frequent-flier miles, they seem painfully unaware of the paradox that their subjects will probably never be able to leave the places where they have been filmed. — Dave Kehr",6682,1

And once again, he is left a fortune by a distant relative. He's taken to New York, where he'll presumably be enticed by the city. Mr. Sandler's films are always about the arrogant getting a deserved comeuppance at the hands of humbler types, but this is the first time he seems a little smug himself.  &quot;Mr. Deeds&quot; has him rehashing a role he has performed so many times before he could be doing this picture in his sleep.

"In outline this story suggests a right-thinking liberal melodrama of healing and moral redemption. Billy Bob Thornton, a white Georgia corrections officer, falls in love with Halle Berry, the widow of a man in whose execution he had participated. Whatever message Marc Forster's rich, troubling film wants to deliver is, thankfully, submerged in details of character and place. The writers (Milo Addica and Will Rokos) show an unusually good command of the idioms of the South — its small courtesies and latent cruelties — and Mr. Forster's eye for detail and for expressive camera angles is impressive. Mr. Thornton outdoes himself, and Ms. Berry proves herself to be an actress of impressive emotional range. The supporting cast, down to the smallest speaking part, is flawless. –  A. O.

"There is a built-in poignancy to any story of a son searching for clues to the identity of a father he barely knew. But in the case of Nathaniel Kahn, the illegitimate son of the great architect Louis I. Kahn, who died  in 1974, that poignancy has an extra twinge, since this mostly absent father strove so diligently to remain a man of mystery. When Kahn collapsed and died of a heart attack in the men's room at Pennsylvania Station, he had been deemed by some to be the greatest living American architect, but his body remained unidentified for two days. At his death he was hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. Nathaniel Kahn was 11 at the time, and the personal documentary he has made, &quot;My Architect,&quot; is a record of his quest to put together the pieces of his father's compartmentalized life. Kahn, it turned out, juggled three families for many years, one official and two not. He was so secretive about his triple life that many of his colleagues didn't even know he was married. &#151; Stephen Holden",6868,1

Under Harry Mastrogeorge's colorless direction, &quot;Venus and Mars&quot; lopes along amiably enough, offering a few smiles and the standard bromides about the importance of being yourself and pursuing your dreams, but is finally more tolerable than memorable. &#151; Dave Kehr",6879,1
"The Coen Brothers' picture is a whimsical, loose-limbed scramble through a Depression-era Mississippi that arises not from the pages of history but from a feverish imagination fed by old movies (chiefly Preston Sturges's &quot;Sullivan's Travels&quot;), folk music and Homer's &quot;Odyssey.&quot;  George Clooney, in a witty, relaxed performance, plays Ulysses Everett McGill, who escapes from a chain gang with two goofy sidekicks (John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson). In the course of their ramblings they encounter corrupt politicians, a blues-guitar prodigy and the Ku Klux Klan as well as a cyclops and a trio of sirens. This whimsical tall tale has a warmth and conviction lacking in some of the brothers' other movies, thanks to a soundtrack full of blues, gospel and country tunes that prove immune to pastiche or cynicism. — A.

"This soft-hearted, squishy-minded prototype for a network sitcom is mildly ingratiating but never laugh-out-loud funny. Kate Hudson is the scuffling gal Friday and Little Ms. Fixit to the queenly chief of a New York fashion agency. On the fast track to A-list Manhattan insufferability, she lives out a dreamy, sanitized version of the &quot;Sex and the City&quot; lifestyle, partying all night, then skipping into the office all a-bubble with nifty little notions that anticipate her boss's every whim. Her life of fun, fun, fun comes to a screeching halt when her older sister and her husband are killed in a car crash, and the will gives Helen custody of three orphaned children. The rest of the movie tells the warm and fuzzy story of Helen's bumbling surrogate parenthood to the brood she inherits, and her discovery of family values and true romance in an outer borough. The movie pretends to address the practical issues of single parenthood in New York but is far too skittish to do more than bring up a problem or two, then solve it with a magical sitcom-ready wave of its wand. — Stephen Holden",6936,1

"When Toula (Nia Vardalos) makes her first appearance in &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding,&quot; she has the kind of shapeless clothes, bad hairstyle and oversize glasses that invariably precede a Cinderella-like transformation in the movies. And it doesn't take long for Toula to emerge from her cocoon, a radiant Hellenic butterfly with designer clothes and contact lenses. All that's required is one long, swooning look at Ian (John Corbett), the high school English teacher who stops by for lunch one day at the neighborhood diner her family operates. Based on Ms. Vardalos's one-woman show, which was based in turn on her upbringing in Winnipeg, Manitoba, &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&quot; is an amiable, offhanded comedy about ethnic identity and last-chance romance. — Dave Kehr",6938,1

To restore the town's economy, and their own manhood, a group of citizens wants to persuade a plastics company to select it as the site for a new factory. To qualify, the town needs a doctor. The villagers lure a shallow Montreal yuppie into their midst and then make themselves over to conform to his fantasies of provincial life. They forsake hockey for cricket and make sure that his fishing expeditions always yield good catches. The movie, a big hit in French Canada, offers easy laughs and warm sentiments. You may think you've seen this kind of sentimental, class-based comedy before, and you have — only with British or Irish accents instead of English subtitles. — A. O. Scott",6942,1

When the confident Jimmy (Bruce Willis) breezes into the house next door, Oz's anxieties are ratcheted up several points on the Richter scale. It turns out that Jimmy is a former Chicago organized-crime figure who ratted out his associates. The movie has an intricate plot, with hit men, love interests, large sums of money and allegiances constantly in motion. But the film is missing the verve of someone who can take a simple idea to the extreme; it must have been directed by a sleepwalker. Despite Mr. Perry's plucky slapstick and the treacherous gunplay that accounts for the second half of the movie, &quot;Yards&quot; is underwhelming, amusing only in fits and starts. — Elvis Mitchell",6945,1

The movie is a poignant study of latchkey children trying establish a fragile community in a corrupt, crime-ridden environment.

"A witty, sexy and merrily literate delight, with an exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets better as the film unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of his &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,&quot; dares to imagine whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty. Meanwhile, this tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving we enjoy today and has great fun presenting the creation of &quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; glitches and all. Ralph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow make a fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully realized starring performance of her career. &#151; Janet Maslin",6952,1

"Zack Snyder's blood-feast in a mall is strictly by the numbers —  the world's most expensively made Troma film. This makes sense: the screenwriter James Gunn crafted &quot;Tromeo and Juliet,&quot; that no-budget B-movie studio's seminal film. Still, this is the first studio picture to exhibit the tacky Troma influence, which means something, like the end of shame in Western civilization, perhaps. The first undead we see in this &quot;reimagining&quot; of the George Romero classic is a little girl with part of her face rotted away, who goes right for her dad's neck. The mother, Ana (Sarah Polley), barely escapes the house intact, and drives away. She runs into Kenneth (Ving Rhames), a uniformed cop. They make their way to the Crossroad Mall, where a handful of security guards have taken up residence. They're determined to keep the zombies out, especially once Ana figures out that the life-free scourge is spread from a zombie bite. A scene in which weapons have to be liberated from a gun store, so the group can get to a marina and sail away to safety — don't ask —  shows why zombie pictures aren't unsettling anymore. The flesh-eaters are picked off like video-game targets. The eventual video game is bound to a lot more fun —  and less slowed down by bad dialogue —  than this &quot;Dead.&quot; — Elvis Mitchell",6981,1

"The writer-director Paul Greengrass's magnetic and impassioned melodrama re-creates the 1972 outbreak of violence during a pro-I.R.A. civil-rights march in Londonderry, Northern Ireland. The director presents the attitudes and the events leading to the horrible clash with a tense, self-aware propulsion — it's like a Brechtian newsreel. Mr. Greengrass makes things move even faster by assembling it as a series of blackouts, and all the cuts build a charged thoughtfulness reminiscent of Costa-Gavras's &quot;Z.&quot; The level of accomplishment in the filmmaking is overwhelming, because in addition to the flash-cut boldness, it's an earthy epic like Gillo Pontecorvo's &quot;Battle of Algiers.&quot; The dramatic scheme of &quot;Sunday&quot; is established with deft simplicity, but the movie doesn't oversimplify the conflicts. — Elvis Mitchell",7022,1

The story is a web of double crosses, hidden agendas and coincidences so intricate that every so often one character has to sit another down and, with flashbacks, explain  (for the audience, too) just what is going on. As is often the case with ambitious, eager first-time filmmakers, Mr. Murray, a prolific director of music videos, stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold. &#151; A. O.

"The prolific Israeli filmmaker Amos Gitai has never lacked nerve. &quot;Kedma,&quot; the newest film by this acerbic social critic is as inflammatory in its way as &quot;Kadosh,&quot; his harsh portrayal of an ultra-Orthdox sect in Jerusalem and its treatment of women. But  &quot;Kedma&quot; has larger issues on its mind than marital customs. In imagining the events of early May 1948, when unauthorized groups of Jewish settlers were arriving from Europe on the shores of Palestine, it questions the very foundations of the Israeli state. The farthest thing from a glorious celebration of the birth of a nation, the movie is a pointed rebuke to a tub-thumping nationalistic epic like &quot;Exodus.&quot; But for all its provocation, &quot;Kedma&quot; is an often dull, incoherent film, and its characters remain frustratingly sketchy. &#151; Stephen Holden",7057,1

"&quot;Skins,&quot; a feature by the American Indian filmmaker Chris Eyre (&quot;Smoke Signals&quot;), is set in and around the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, a windswept slum just a few miles away from Mount Rushmore. Conditions on the reservation are so appalling &#151; rampant unemployment, epidemic alcohol abuse, woefully inadequate sanitation &#151; that Mr. Eyre continually interrupts his slight narrative to lament them. And &quot;Skins&quot; might have been better off as a documentary, with less of Mr. Eyre's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage.  Based on the 1995 novel by Adrian C. Louis, the movie is a study in helpless rage &#151; the rage of one man, Rudy Yellow Lodge (Eric Schweig), a reservation police officer whose small attempts to improve the lot of his people don't seem to be adding up to much. &#151; Dave Kehr",7080,1

"Rose Troche's adaptation of A.M. Homes's book of stories, which weaves together jarring comic-gothic vignettes of suburban misery into a somber, lurid tapestry, invites comparison to Robert Altman's &quot;Short Cuts.&quot; But whereas Mr. Altman cobbled Raymond Carver's sorrowful deadpan into a vision of social disconnection, Ms. Troche mines Ms. Homes's jagged minimalism for its grim, compassionate metaphysics. The four families under scrutiny, who live within a few yards of each other, present a tableau of fallen humanity, trying to exercise free will in a cruel and absurd universe. Glenn Close is especially fine as a mother grieving for her comatose son (Joshua Jackson), but the rest of the cast comes close to matching her precision and restraint. Though it has some awkward patches, and occasionally risks melodrama, &quot;Safety&quot; is on the whole a remarkably graceful satire, out of which sympathy sprouts like an unruly weed. &#151; A. O.

"Despite the moments of hilarity cobbled together for this film's trailer, which takes the exaggerated voluptuousness of its stars — Antonio Banderas, with his Iberian good looks and musical delivery, and Angelina Jolie with her fearless avidity — this remake of &quot;Mississippi Mermaid&quot; is a drag. The most original thing about it is the audacity it took to use the word &quot;original&quot; in the title. Mr. Banderas is a worldly coffee plantation owner who discovers his naivete after Ms. Jolie — who he actually gets to call shameless — hoodwinks him in the game of love. Spiritually and financially bankrupt, he chases her. Every single incident is overdramatized, and the whole thing, filmed by the talented cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, has been lighted like the lobby of a Philippe Starck hotel. - Elvis Mitchell",7159,1

"The werewolf legend has been treated as a metaphor for the onset of puberty in a number of films, including Gene Fowler Jr.'s 1957 &quot;I Was a Teenage Werewolf&quot; and Rod Daniel's 1985 &quot;Teen Wolf.&quot; But those films approached the subject from a male perspective. &quot;Ginger Snaps,&quot; a Canadian feature directed by John Fawcett and written by  Karen Walton, is perhaps the first werewolf movie to recast the imagery from a female perspective. Mr. Fawcett spends a great deal of time laying out the sociological and psychological underpinnings of his tale, so that when the standard horror-movie action takes over in the second half, the bloodletting has some real thematic resonance. Because the characters are so well established, the film can have fun with its own premises without turning into an empty camp exercise. – Dave Kehr",7196,1

The pair must contend with extra-terrestrial law enforcement and a nosy earth-bound social worker, and their triumph over these adversities involves the usual Disney blend of comic anarchy, musical numbers (this time with an Elvis theme) and heart-tugging sentimentality. The movie's family relationships are addressed with low-key realism, and the animation has a lovely, gentle precision, with plenty of room for visual comedy but less of the noise and chaos that have become the hallmarks of 3-D animation. This movie suggests that old-fashioned, flat, painted kind still has much to offer. &#151; A. O. Scott",7201,1

"Baltasar Kormakur's cagey, wafer-thin Icelandic comedy brims with surliness, from Hlynur, its remorseless, do-nothing protagonist, to its score by Damon Albarn of Blur and Einar Orn Benediktsson of the Sugarcubes. Hlynur is nearly 30 and talks a wry game about being unwanted and unemployable when he just doesn't want to expend the effort it takes to leave his mother's house. When he does get out, it is to perform activities that are sure to upset people and bring a disdainful smirk to his face. So, when Lola (Victoria Abril) comes to stay with his mother, Hlynur finds enough energy to stumble into a clinch with her. The movie feels as though it is not about much, but it is so well acted that the lassitude becomes a part of the atmosphere. - Elvis Mitchell",7203,1
"Mike Figgis's newest confessional-improvisational work rises and falls on the talents of his performers, a cast that includes David Schwimmer, Salma Hayek, Burt Reynolds, Lucy Liu, Saffron Burrows, Julian Sands, John Malkovich and Rhys Ifans, who wins by a mile. Set in a Venetian hotel, the multi-layered movie is an amalgam of plots, filmmaking styles and effects. Though finally overwhelmed by a preening lassitude, the movie is never less than fascinating, breaking into multi-screen scenarios like Mr. Figgis's 2000 experiment, &quot;Timecode.&quot; Revolving primarily around a film crew making a version of &quot;The Duchess of Malfi,&quot; the film stretches out for long, competitive turns among the actors. In one of the subplots, Mr. Ifans is the charismatic director, and Mr. Schwimmer his scheming producer and right-hand man. The connective thread of the movie is loneliness and secrets — which serve as a function of selfishness. Intriguingly, and perhaps even maddeningly, &quot;Hotel&quot; always seems to be in flux, which is a real achievement. Some may say it's like watching wine age in a bottle, but the movie also offers the sense of the vintage changing from minute to minute. In a summer when you can almost hear the sighs of boredom coming from behind the scenes, that's a worthwhile pursuit. — Elvis Mitchell",7204,1

Emir Kusturica plays a fisherman convicted of a senseless murder, who is placed under the supervision of the local military commander (Daniel Auteuil) and his wife (Juliette Binoche) until a guillotine and an executioner can be found. The film's moral seriousness, coupled with the complex triangle of jealousy, honor and sympathy that develops between the condemned man and his protectors, makes &quot;The Widow of St. Pierre&quot; an unusually satisfying period drama.

The movie, which jumps back and forth between Havana and New York and offers a musical mosaic of Afro-Cuban styles, mostly salsa based, could be described as a basic course: Afro-Cuban music 101. Besides the director, the most articulate of several commentators is the jazz pianist, composer and educator Billy Taylor, who has been a long-time champion of Afro-Cuban music. The movie's  cheerful view of contemporary Havana is markedly different from Wim Wenders' elegiac  &quot;Buena Vista Social Club.&quot; &#151; Stephen Holden",7257,1

"The first full-length feature from Aardman Animation is immensely satisfying, a divinely relaxed and confident film that credits youngsters' interest in a cartoon more substantial than the standard bland musical. The movie employs modeled latex figures to tell the story of a group of chickens desperate to escape from a chicken farm before they are turned into pies. Nick Park, who also directed the fabulous Wallace and Gromit shorts, transfers all of the deftness and imagination of his shorter films into an artful big-screen realization. And this briskly paced epic uses Peter Lord's continuing satirical take on British modesty and balmy superiority. ''Chicken Run'' parodies cultural touchstones from ''Stalag 17'' to ''Star Trek'' to the loose-cannon heroics of Mel Gibson, the voice of Rocky, the matinee-idol flying rooster who is asked to teach the hens to fly. Finally, it shows that the hens can save themselves through the pluck of Ginger (Julia Sawalha) and doesn't make a big deal of this. — Elvis Mitchell",7259,1

Mr. Provenzano is a grandnephew of the Teamster official Anthony (Tony Pro) Provenzano, and is scheduled to begin a prison term in New Jersey on Aug. 15, 2003, having pleaded guilty to charges of racketeering and tax evasion in connection with his printing business.

"If ever a movie star embodied the lean and hungry look that actors consider synonymous with street credibility, it is Adrien Brody, whose character, Jack, in &quot;Love the Hard Way&quot; is a petty criminal who specializes in posing as a policeman and shaking down Asian businessmen in sexually compromising situations. But Jack is also catnip for the kind of woman who fantasizes about taking a walk on the wild side. And in the shaky screen adaptation of a novel by Wang Shuo, Claire (Charlotte Ayanna), the woman who goes for that stroll against her better judgment, is a studious biology major at Columbia. If its early scenes have a bracing hard-boiled sting, the movie goes slack (and ultimately loses credibility) as it drifts into mushier territory and stumbles through three possible endings. — Stephen Holden",7277,1

But the image that comes across in the Canadian director Renny Bartlett's impressionistic film biography (and confirmed by old photographs) is much the opposite. He is a frizzy-haired nose-thumbing avant-gardist. Homosexually inclined (although married), he fit the prototype of the artist as social misfit and compulsive contrarian. Fueled by Simon McBurney's incandescent performance in the title role, &quot;Eisenstein&quot; is a portrait of the artist as political and spiritual renegade, a one-man wildfire that ultimately proved uncontainable. &#151; Stephen Holden",7281,1

"Simon West's transformation of the famous video game — a pinnacle of geek culture — may be the best film version of such a feat ever. However, given that past examples include &quot;Super Mario Brothers&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat,&quot; that's not saying much. Lavish and dumb, the movie features interiors bigger that most of the member countries of the European Union. The dashing adventurer and archaeologist Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) has a living room that's the size of Belgium; it's an 11-year-old American's dream of what Europe must be like. Ms. Jolie is having the time of her life, with her good-to-go vascularity and perma-halfsmile. (She smirks more here than Bob Hope did in his entire career.) But it's nothing more than a predictable save-the-world spectacle inspired by a video game that took its lead from Maxim magazine. With Jon Voight as her father, serving the purpose dead parents always do in action-adventure: appearing in flashbacks to advance the plot. - Elvis Mitchell",7283,1

Divided into two parts, the movie begins in the early 90's at Sarah Lawrence College, where Coles falls in love with Sam (Maya Stange) and has a threesome with her and her bisexual best friend, Thea (Kathleen Roberts). In part two, the movie leaps ahead a decade to track the same characters in New York City, where Coles is living with Claire (Petra Wright). When Sam reappears on the scene, he finds he's still in love with her and can't contain himself. Filmed in digital video, the sour little study of Gen X yuppies and their discontents is reasonably convincing and well-acted but very minor. &#151; Stephen Holden",7285,1

"This Coen Brothers film is something not seen in movie theaters for a long time: an intelligent, modern screwball comedy, a minor classic on the order of the competent, fast-talking curveballs about deception and greed like Mitchell Leisen's &quot;Easy Living&quot; and Billy Wilder's &quot;Major and the Minor.&quot; &quot;Cruelty&quot; shares something with comedic entries in the Coen canon like &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; and &quot;Raising Arizona&quot;: a full-blooded movie star performance to put it squarely into the strike zone. This time the good work comes from George Clooney. His gift of gab is perfectly suited for Miles, the crème de la crème of divorce lawyers. Miles has everything but a soul, though he doesn't actually look as if he'd require one. And the babe he falls for isn't exactly the person to give him one either. Marilyn (Catherine  Zeta-Jones), as delectable as a white-chocolate Easter Bunny, has been tagged for a vicious divorce by her husband, a serial adulterer, after she catches him cheating. Her uptown-girl beauty and silken opacity make her the kind of trophy Miles would want to win. And when she jabs a No. 2 pencil into Miles's heart by showing up with her beau, a Texas millionaire (Billy Bob Thornton), Miles is horrified, but not defeated. That's what makes the picture work so beautifully; it is a film about underhanded professionals by filmmakers who delight in the epitome of criminal enterprise. — Elvis Mitchell",7289,1

"The credits inform us that Robert Rodriguez, mastermind of the &quot;Spy Kids&quot; franchise, shot, chopped and scored this latest bloody, jokey folk ballad about a lone killer (Antonio Banderas) with soulful eyes and a lethal guitar. The digital video cinematography has unusual depth and luster, the action sequences are punchy and inventive, and the music is pretty good, too. Unfortunately, it seems as if the writing and directing, which Robert Rodriguez also did, were something of an afterthought. There are some witty moments, mostly courtesy of Johnny Depp, who plays a C.I.A. agent messing around in Mexico, and some high-impact many-gun salutes to the action auteurs Sergio Leone and John Woo. But the mood of tongue-in-cheek, romantic mayhem is spoiled by the picture's incoherence, and by its resort to appalling extremes of violence when nothing else is working.

"This warm, funny, inventive documentary is both a diary and a kind of extended essay on poverty, thrift and the curious place of scavenging in French history and culture. Agnes Varda, an intrepid woman in her early 70's and one of the bravest and most idiosyncratic of French filmmakers, spent eight months traveling through France recording the lives of people who gather what others have thrown away or left behind. Varda's gleaners retain a resilient, generous humanity, which is clearly brought to the surface by her own tough, open spirit. The film is studded with found metaphors and serendipitous insights. — A. O. Scott",7321,1

Clearly, it took some determination on Mr. Westbrook's part to reach his goals in life, and in his current occupation, as the director of the Peter Westbrook Foundation, where he teaches fencing to disadvantaged children, he is doing his best to pass on his energy and focus to a new generation — with apparent success.

"Vampires and werewolves are at war, and  a lot of them are wearing long black leather coats like Keanu Reeves's in &quot;The Matrix.&quot; You'd think there would be a lot more neck-piercing, blood-sucking and general mauling, but the combatants seem to enjoy doing choreographed battle with semi-automatic weapons in both hands instead. Kate Beckinsale stars as a vampire warrior, and Scott Speedman (formerly of &quot;Felicity&quot; on WB) plays a young human doctor who doesn't know nearly enough about his blood line. The film does have some visual style, sometimes a little too much. Otherwise it achieves only loudness, aggressive confusion and one of the silliest head-splittings in film history. You can't say that Danny McBride's script is laden with clichés. The dialogue (&quot;We have much to discuss&quot;; &quot;Mark my words. Soon you'll be seeing things my way&quot;) isn't that purposeful. It's just stiff. — Anita Gates",7370,1

"The real history of pop music over the last half century is as much a story of technological  innovation as it is a star-driven genealogy that connects the usual legends in an elaborate  family tree of styles and influences. To hear the producer and recording engineer Tom  Dowd describe his pioneering role in the evolution of studio recording, from monaural to  stereo to multi-tracking to digital, is to begin to understand the degree to which machines,  as much as performers, have shaped the changing sound of pop. Dowd, who died in 2002,  was an engineer and producer on classic recordings by Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, the  Allman Brothers and Lynyrd Skynyrd, as well as jazz legends. In this documentary, which interweaves snippets of vintage performances, reminiscences and tributes, Dowd comes across as a sophisticated but unpretentious studio wizard whose respect for musicians always took precedence over his mastery of gadgetry. &#151; Stephen Holden",7398,1

And in &quot;Dark Blue,&quot; Ron Shelton's melodrama of malfeasance in the Los Angeles Police Department, it is hard to know whom to feel sorrier for: Bobby Keough, the junior detective, or Scott Speedman, the actor who plays him. Keough is a dewy, pretty innocent ensnared in a web of tribalism and dishonesty. He is, through family connections, part of a seamy pocket of arrogant lawlessness within the L.A.P.D. Keough's crisis of conscience is the movie's most obvious and least interesting narrative arc, but the real center of the dramatic action is his partner, a strutting, shaggy-haired cowboy named Eldon Perry, played by Kurt Russell with the heat, precision and dexterity of a Duane Allman guitar solo. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie does not live up to Mr. Russell's performance. &#151; A. O. Scott",7447,1

Two families, feuding over land, kill each other off one by one. We witness this cruel way of life through the eyes of a young child whose beloved older brother awaits his fate, having killed a member of the rival clan. The harshness is leavened by the arrival of a pair of traveling circus performers, who import a touch of Felliniesque sweetness into the tragic atmosphere. Tragedy wins in the end, but so does Mr. Salles's passionate, romantic humanism. – A. O. Scott",7454,1

K.&quot; It is a concise summary of every who-killed-Kennedy paranoid thriller ever made, reduced to two principal characters, a single camera and a running time of 88 minutes. &#151; Dave Kehr",7525,1

Since 1971, the Country Bears Jamboree has been a fixture of Disney World in Orlando, Fla., and clearly its down-home brand of ursine animatronic entertainment was crying out for adaptation into a big-screen feature. The plot combines &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; and &quot;Almost Famous&quot; (but with bears, and a G rating), with an excruciating dollop of Disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure. &#151; A.

Mr. Blamire's scientist is one of a group of characters — including a pair of space aliens accompanied by their pet giant mutant — searching the woods around Lake Arrowhead for a mysterious elements called &quot;atmospherium.&quot;  The picture wisely avoids a broad, campy style in favor of straight-faced pastiche, but never breaks through into laugh-out-loud comedy.

"It's probably best that the plot of  &quot;The Hunted&quot; &#151; such as it is &#151; doesn't get in the way of the action sequences, most of which involve Tommy Lee Jones chasing Benecio Del Toro throughout the Pacific Northwest with occasional stops for hand-to-hand combat that make you fear for the actors' safety. Mr. Del Toro is Aaron Hallam, a government-sanctioned killing machine being pursued by L.T. Bonham (Mr. Jones), an independent-contractor tracker brought in by the F.B.I. before Hallam slaughters a cross-section of the population of the Pacific Standard Time Zone. This isn't a movie &#151; it's a police report &#151; and the strictly-the-facts terseness of the story makes that more than clear. That tone is first reflected in the use of Johnny Cash's laconic moroseness over the opening title to set the mood, but it also establishes a level of expectation that the film can't live up to. The director William Friedkin might as well paint bull's-eyes on the backs of the actors, since it's obvious that &quot;The Hunted&quot; regards them as nothing but expendable. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",7585,1

As she nears 40, however, Jacki is contemplating hanging up her rock 'n' roll shoes unless the band secures a decent record deal. Ms. Gershon, who produced the movie, gives a hot-wired performance (she suggests a hybrid  of Chrissie Hynde and Joan Jett) that infuses the film with a bracing charge of  authenticity. But if the movie, adapted from an autobiographical play by Cheri Lovedog, is terrific on ambiance and street language, its melodramatic story involving a rape and  payback often feels forced. — Stephen Holden",7603,1

"The mood of wry disillusion that seeps through the screen adaptation of Graham Greene's novel &quot;The Quiet American&quot; is sounded in the movie's opening moments by the voice of Michael Caine musing dreamily on the mystique of Saigon in the early 1950's. It is a place, declares his character, Thomas Fowler, where colors and tastes seem sharper than they do elsewhere and where even the rain has a special intensity. Fowler is a wistfully cynical British journalist who has fled an arid marriage in England to live in Southeast Asia, where he is reporting on the Vietnamese fight for independence from French colonial rule. Fowler may be the richest character of Mr. Caine's screen career. Slipping into his skin with an effortless grace, this great English actor gives a performance of astonishing understatement whose tone wavers delicately between irony and sadness. — Stephen Holden",7663,1

"An honorable B+ term paper of a movie: sober, scrupulous and earnestly respectful of its literary source. The problem is that the source, Philip Roth's 2000 novel, is not especially sober or scrupulous: it is an angry, ungainly squall of a book, a clamorous defense of sexual vitality in an age of Puritan censoriousness and a lyrical inquiry into the mysteries of race, old age and recent American history. As Coleman Silk, a Classics professor chased from his job after being absurdly accused of racism, Anthony Hopkins has a loose, mellow exuberance that almost persuades you to overlook a basic, insurmountable improbability, namely that his character is a black man who has spent most of his adulthood passing for white. Nicole Kidman, playing Coleman's abused, impoverished and much younger lover, is almost as hard to believe, but her performance is nonetheless serious and unaffected. Some of the best work comes in smaller parts: Wentworth Miller as young Coleman; Anna Deavere Smith as his mother; and especially Jacinda Barrett as the great love of his youth. The movie has many memorable, moving scenes — as well as a few awkward and embarrassing ones — but it never coheres either dramatically or intellectually, largely because it lacks a way to approximate the novel's unifying force, which is Mr. Roth s unruly, passionate and brilliant voice. — A.

"Krutin Patel's film &quot;ABCD&quot; (the initials stand for American-born confused desi) explores the internal tug of war affecting upwardly mobile young Indian-Americans brought up in this country. Desi is a word for someone of Indian extraction living outside India, and &quot;ABCD&quot; a slang term of amused disparagement applied to those who deny (and sometimes attempt to cover up) their backgrounds. The central characters, Nina (Sheetal Sheth) and her older brother Raj (Faran Tahir), are both successful young professionals (she works in advertising, he in accounting) and both struggling with similarly conflicting impulses. &quot;ABCD&quot; doesn't make light of its characters' conflicts, nor does it try to resolve them with feel-good formulaic solutions. – Stephen Holden",7681,1

To, er, flesh out a rather thin story about two pleasant, indefatigable Australians, a photographer named Josh (David Wenham) and a dressmaker named Cin (Susie Porter),  who spend three days in bed (and on the floor, and in the bathtub), Jonathan Teplitzky, the novice writer and director, throws in a great deal of talk. – A.

Affecting the pseudo-macho bark of a drill instructor, he suggests Tony Robbins as a shrimpy, steroid-enhanced gym rat. White and his robotic cronies represent the Goliath  that Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn), the slobby, nice guy who owns a nearby low-rent gym, sets out to slay with the help of his nerdy pals who form a dodgeball team to compete for $50,000 first prize in a Las Vegas tournament.

It's an experimental film in the true sense of the term, allowing Mr. von Trier to try out techniques that he would later refine into the more controlled and graceful stylings of &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot; and &quot;Dancer in the Dark.&quot; Fascinated, as always, by the sufferings of women, Mr. Von Trier warms instantly to Medea (Kirsten Olesen), the original scorned woman. &#151; Dave Kehr",7690,1

It's the raw expenditure of energy and the canniness of the staging that should pull audiences in and keep them rooted. This of course is undoubtedly the best way to present a movie take on Bob Fosse's digressive musical version of &quot;Chicago.&quot; This new picture maintains the relentless spirit of Fosse's blunt suavity and the breathless, black-silk enthusiasm of Kander and Ebb's songs. Catherine Zeta-Jones, in Louise Brooks wig and ruthless smile, is Roxie's fellow felon and jailbird, Velma.

"Julie Taymor's celebration of the life of the Mexican surrealist painter Frida Kahlo almost transcends the limitations of the biopic genre. Yes, the events of Kahlo's passionate, painful life are flattened out and crowded together, and no, we don't really understand her any better at the end of the movie, but when it departs from the conventions of realism, &quot;Frida&quot; explodes with color, music and sensuality. Salma Hayek plays the artist with more charisma than insight, and her scenes with Alfred Molina (who plays Diego Rivera, Kahlo's straying, devoted husband) are clunky and literal, but Ms. Taymor is a playful, inventive and emotionally astute filmmaker constrained (as her subject rarely was) by convention.

"This creepy romantic comedy is filled with scenes of soft-core cyber-sex in which lonely unattached singles (all but one from New York) coax each other to ecstasy without ever touching each other. The mechanical, hokey plot imagines what would happen if a group of cyber-sex devotees, some of them in it for the  money, others kinky exhibitionists, others forlorn fantasists desperate for a relationship, tear themselves away from their computers and experiment with face-to-face contact. Despite its convincing performances and skillful use of split-screen techniques, it is an ultimately dispiriting affair that leaves you with a nagging &quot;is that all there is?&quot; feeling about sex in general. &#151; Stephen Holden",7707,1

For in its heart of hearts this portrait of a troubled African-American is a realistic, downbeat drama of people struggling for a living and of generational and marital strife aggravated by economic hardship. &#151; Stephen Holden",7722,1

His most endearing client (Jason Lee) is a warm, fuzzy billionaire computer nerd who loves to skateboard but finds it's lonely at the top.

This flat romantic comedy by one of the writers of &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; and &quot;Zoolander,&quot; both of which starred Mr. Stiller, also fails to provide any reason a spunky girl-next-door like Ms. Aniston's character would give Mr. Stiller's uptight nerd the time of day.  His troubles begin on the first day of his St. Barts honeymoon with his new wife (Debra  Messing), who deserts him for a hunky, French scuba diver (Hank Azaria). Philip  Seymour Hoffman, Alec Baldwin and Bryan Brown have colorful turns as, respectively, Mr. Stiller's  slobby best friend, his crude boss, and an insurance client who likes to leap from office  buildings with a parachute. — Stephen Holden",7745,1

The movie feels more like a breezy, jazz-inflected version of the original: it's a triumph of flourish, with all weathered movie-star-size gestures. &quot;The Good Thief&quot; combines American flamboyance and French existentialist delirium. As played by Mr. Nolte, Bob is a brawny noir pin-up as trickster — an old dog who never lets on how many tricks he knows.  Mr. Jordan gives the proceedings a double-heist plot turn. This ultimate caper film has a brazen ebullience, something unusual for Mr. Jordan. — Elvis Mitchell",7750,1

Both the satisfyingly grainy texture of Mr. Harris's images and his decision to shoot without sound, adding narration and music later, free him decisively from the look and feel of the standard public-television documentary. Yet this is fundamentally a recruiting film that intends to interest other African-Americans into exploring their spiritual traditions, and it displays no real curiosity about its subject except to insist that it is the true path to enlightenment.  Mr. Harris's stylistic gifts are quite evident; his reportorial instincts are a bit more muffled. — Dave Kehr",7769,1

The film has one or two funny moments,  but these seem more the result of the laws of probability than of any   inspiration on the part of the actors or the filmmakers.

"&quot;Chihwaseon,&quot; a film by Im Kwon-Taek, the prolific grand old man of South Korean cinema, is one eminent artist's biography of another. The subject of the film is Jang Seung-Ub, a 19th-century painter known by the pseudonym Ohwon who lived, in Mr. Im's rendition, like a vagabond rock star. Jang, born a commoner and discovered as a boy by a sympathetic aristocrat, dazzled and scandalized his country's politically fragmented ruling class and spent his long career in and out of favor, and in and out of trouble. Mr. Im's meandering, episodic tale keeps its subject at a distance, observing even his wildest moments with decorous detachment. But if the director can be a plodding storyteller, he is also a visual artist as inspired, at times, as Ohwon himself. — A. O. Scott",7812,1

The setting is Pleasure Island  a booze-soaked, low-rent resort owned and operated by a terminally laid-back rock star named Coconut Pete (Bill Paxton). When a new group of party animals arrives at the island, things seem to be going well enough — the amusements include nonstop drinking and a live-action Pac-Man game, with staff members dressed as fruit running through a maze.  But then members of the staff begin turning up dead in various grisly ways (quite grisly, in fact, for a comedy). Who's responsible?  Who cares?  Certainly not the filmmakers, who lay out their standard wares with the weariness of an overworked street vendor:  a topless female here, a scatological gag there, a hip movie reference somewhere else. — Dave Kehr",7817,1

Thomas, his daughter Carla, Wilson Pickett, Sam Moore (of the soul duo Sam and Dave), and especially Jerry Butler turn in performances that are so adrenalized and heartfelt that young audiences encountering the music for the first time could easily find themselves converted into old fogies longing  for the good old days. — Stephen Holden",7824,1

"The calculating monster who pulls the strings in Dariush Mehrjui's heartbreaking film is an imperious mother-in-law (Jamileh Sheikhi) whose selfishness and pride put her in the same elite league with some of Hollywood's most formidable Gorgons. On learning that her daughter-in-law is infertile, this termagant, who is obsessed with having a male grandchild to carry on the family line, systematically undermines the marriage of her only son, Reza (Ali Mosaffa). Without being simplistic, the gripping and beautifully acted film suggests that in Iran, contemporary attitudes toward love and marriage and modern psychology are no match for the combined force of social pressure and Islamic tradition when ruthlessly appropriated as weapons of intimidation. &quot;Leila&quot; is, in a word, devastating. - Stephen Holden",7831,1

"As you watch this riveting, all-elbows-and-knuckles documentary, you may wonder how long can it gingerly bypass the piles of syringes, resentment and bad karma that mark the path to VH1's documentary series &quot;Behind the Music&quot;? For most of its running time, actually, the director David C. Thomas manages to keep the film charging ahead of the wastrel clichés that dot VH1's video tribute to rock 'n' roll wreckage because we're not just using one eye to catch a cobbled-together archive about Milli Vanilli or some band that beat the odds to one-hit wonderland. Rather, the proto-punk warriors known as the MC5 left a dent that outlasts their mostly negligible records sales, and the director's curiosity is piqued by the group's sociological impact. The band's members &#151; Wayne Kramer, Fred &quot;Sonic&quot; Smith, Rob Tyner, Michael Davis and Dennis Thompson &#151;  were caught up in the desires that ensnare most musicians: drugs and love of the audience. But for most of them, delivering body blows to the dozing status quo was as much a part of the motivation as any other. Such an ideal seems particularly quaint and, despite the fury from Smith and Tyner, attractively ingenuous. As depicted in &quot;Testimonial,&quot; the robust clash of ideology and ego &#151;  or the heart and the loins &#151;  is a great story, a shower of sparks. More important, given the crass commercial thrust of music these days, a band pursuing anything other than Soundscan numbers is such an unusual tale, it's surprising a dramatic version of the MC5 lifespan, which flamed out in 1972, has yet to be announced. With the aptly titled &quot;MC5: A True Testimonial,&quot; Mr. Thomas captures the taste for revolt in Detroit that inspired the MC5, a desperation that fueled more important pop figures (besides just Motown artists) than maybe in any other city &#151;  an outlaw eruption that ranged from Parliament/Funkadelic to Iggy Pop. It's a shame that someone hasn't gotten around to building a film on the joyful noise that kept the city vital. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",7838,1

Returning to Fire Island, where he first met Leah, he encounters both a young woman who looks exactly like her, and a young man who looks exactly like him.  He conspires to bring them together, in a gesture he hopes will redeem his unhappy existence.  There's a lot more to &quot;Returning Mickey Stern,&quot; but what this movie really needs is a lot less.  Michael Prywes would be a much more engaging filmmaker if he learned to trust his material more, and not dress it up with redundant detail and convoluted plot twists.  &quot;Returning Mickey Stern&quot; is a sweet, well-intended picture, which, like its title character, is not quite good enough for the big leagues. &#151; Dave Kehr",7942,1

"When it confines its attention to the giant pandas and the spectacular Chinese landscape, this 2-D Imax feature makes reasonably good use of the Imax format; it's like watching an expensive, high-definition slide show in your neighbor's cavernous, steeply banked living room. But just as the vast, square Imax screen magnifies panda-haunches and steep, jungle-clad gorges, its relentless scale also enlarges a half-baked, mediocre little adventure story into something almost grotesquely bad. What might have been a pleasant nature documentary — though a somewhat phony one, since the pandas were transported to China from American zoos — has instead become a gooey, overscored, underwritten, and mercifully short period costume drama. - A. O. Scott",7961,1
"Taking some liberties with Vladimir Nabokov's 1930 novel, Marleen Gorris has composed a delicate fable about memory, devotion and the vulnerability of genius in a cruelly ordinary world. John Turturro plays Alexander Luzhin, an eccentric chess prodigy tormented by memories of an unhappy childhood. He and Emily Watson, who plays Natalia, a young Russian woman whose love for Luzhin shocks her socially ambitious mother, are wonderfully matched. Chess afficionados and devotees of Nabokov may miss the novel's cerebral dazzle, but Ms. Gorris's film, wisely concentrating on the more accessible emotional aspects of her source, succeeds on its own terms as a touching and elegant period romance. -- A.

The director's last two films, &quot;Not One Less&quot; and &quot;The Road Home,&quot; paid tribute to the stubborn resilience of China's peasants.

"The only real touch of class in the rickety little  romantic comedy is Kyle MacLachlan's dead-on impersonation of Cary Grant's ghost.  Lounging around in a paisley dressing gown, dropping pallid witticisms in Grant's  signature staccato style with just the right accent, the actor finds an easy balance between  affectionate imitation and amusing parody. That ghost haunts the movie's troubled young  protagonist Alim (Jimi Mistry), a gay South Asian Muslim leaving with a British lover in  London. The movie is the latest manifestation of an already stale sub-sub genre: the  multicultural romance in which a gay couple of mixed ethnicity tries to conceal their  relationship from visiting tradition-bound relatives who assume the lovers are  heterosexual roommates. Mr. MacLachlan's Grant is Alim's imaginary advisor. The humor fizzles, and except for Mr. MacLachlan the acting is wooden and overstated. &#151; Stephen Holden",7983,1

Adding to their problems is the pressure exerted by their son to vacate their apartment, which he owns, and settle in old-age home. If the wonderfully acted film wraps old age and death in a cozy blanket of sentiment, its advice to stay young at heart and savor every precious moment of the time  you have left is unassailable. — Stephen Holden",7986,1

"Gabriel Baur's Swiss-financed documentary takes as its subject the subculture of &quot;drag kings&quot; &#151; women who enjoy dressing as men, and acting out their fantasies, perceptions and fears of male behavior. Built around an evening of drag king performance at New York's Club Cassanova, the film introduces us to several different practicing kings, each of whom has her own reasons for adopting male dress.  We meet, for example, Diane Torr, whose drag persona is that of a drab, angry middle-aged man; she seems as much an anthropologist as she is an entertainer.  The gestures, the stride and the attitude of her character seem to have been minutely researched and are impeccably reproduced, adding up to a portrait of middle-American frustration and rage that is as poignant as it is frightening. The latter sections of Ms. Baur's film take her to London, where a different, more radically experimental drag king scene prevails.  Here, her interview subjects are transgendered persons &#151; who have transformed their bodies through surgical procedures or the use of hormones &#151; and no longer see themselves as belonging exclusively to one sex or the other.  Ms. Baur  has clearly earned the trust and respect of her subjects,  and they have repaid her with an intimate glimpse of their singular lives. &#151; Dave Kehr",7989,1

Ms. Kidman's Woolf is one of the most disturbing portraits of mental imbalance ever brought to the screen. Ms. Moore (as a depressed Southern California housewife in 1951) and Ms. Streep (as a book editor in contemporary New  York) give richly shaded portrayals of intelligent high-strung women on the verge. David  Hare's lean, incisive screenplay and Philip Glass's churning minimalist score fold stories  that take place in different eras into a single timeless plane.

These men can work orthographic wonders, but it never lifts them out of their self-imposed exiles. Without much else racking up points in their isolated lives, the Scrabble players' monomania amounts to little, and these contestants seem like words that lose their beauty when they're never put in a sentence. &#151; Ned Martel",8003,1

In &quot;Earring,&quot; the story offered is Griet's, a scullery maid who became the muse of Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth) and the subject of the painting of the same name. Ms. Johansson  is photographed so that her skin is as opalescent as her earring, but the movie is opaque.

"Written and directed by Robert Bresson, and shot in limpid black-and-white, this 1966 allegory tracks the journey of two innocents, the teenage Marie (Anna Wiazemsky, who later married Jean-Luc Godard) and the soulful donkey of the film's title that's adopted by her family when she and the animal are very young. In the course of Bresson's short tale, both Marie and Balthazar will endure a crucible of suffering &#151; she at the rough hands of a punk in a black leather jacket, the donkey at the equally rough hands of various vicious masters. The critic J. Hoberman has observed that &quot;Balthazar&quot; is about a donkey in about the same way that &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; is about a whale, but it is also true that this is a story about an animal. Inspired by a passage from Dostoevsky's &quot;Idiot,&quot; Bresson makes Balthazar the moral center of his film, perhaps because, unlike Marie and the rest of the men and women in this fallen world, the donkey doesn't need to die to achieve grace. (It's worth noting that Bresson used a Schubert Sonata as &quot;a kind of language for the donkey's soul.&quot;) Over the years, some critics have classified Bresson's work as unapproachable, even punishing. For these professional philistines the idea that movies can be serious, more than tricks and trashy entertainment, is apparently anathema. Don't you believe it: &quot;Au Hasard Balthazar&quot; is a masterpiece of the art, but a masterpiece that stirs the heart and soul as much as the mind. &#151; Manohla Dargis",8039,1

There are espionage writers who use the genre to explore the complexities of geopolitics, but Robert Ludlum, on whose novel this competent, enjoyable picture is based, was not one of them. At a time when thrillers are shadowed by real-world anxieties, the implausibility and irrelevance of this movie, which amusingly imagines the C.I.A. as a super-competent, virtually omniscient operation, comes as something of a relief. Mr. Damon handles his characters' existential crisis with fierce adroitness, and Doug Limans direction has an old-fashioned swiftness and efficiency.  &mdash; A. O. Scott",8060,1

"The blond, sleepy-eyed hero of this Australian comedy lives out a fantasy entertained by every child who has ever watched a helium balloon float into the sky and developed a lump in the throat as it disappeared. What would it be like to go along for the ride, drifting over the landscape to a destination determined by the whims of the wind? The movie joins that  fantasy to a pleasantly sappy fable of new beginnings that suggests a Frank Capra film  sweetened with an extra layer of sugar glaze. Danny Morgan, a cement truck driver in Sydney, inflates a cluster of giant balloons attached to a lawn chair and sails off into the wild blue yonder where he starts a new life and meets his true love. The movie is only a trifle, but it has its charms. &#151; Stephen Holden",8083,1

"The breathtaking cinematography of migrating birds in Jacques Perrin's mystical  documentary transports you to an exalted realm where nature  operates under its own inviolable laws, and humanity is portrayed as a crude, destructive  interloper in the natural scheme of things. The movie, whose few words, spoken the  director, are explanatory captions, offers a sweeping global tour from a bird's-eye view,  dressed up with a new-age score by Bruno Coulais. And as the images of flying birds  (along with the often harsh, seemingly urgent sounds of their cries) in perfect, swooping  formation accumulate, the film speaks wistfully to humankind's profound, residual  longing to soar through the heavens without mechanical help. On the negative side, the  information is so sketchy that at the end of the experience, you're left almost as much in  the dark as you were at the beginning. — Stephen Holden",8100,1

"With &quot;Sia: The Dream of the Python,&quot; the African filmmaker Dani Kouyaté continues the project he began in 1995 with his first feature, &quot;Keita!&quot;: to find a cinematic equivalent for the voice of the griot, the traditional singer-storyteller whose responsibility it was to convey the history and culture of his people in the absence of a written language. Sia,&quot; derived from a play by Moussa Diagana, is a reconstruction of a myth of the Wagadu people of Western Africa dating from the seventh century.  The source may lie in legend, but the essence of &quot;Sia&quot; is political and contemporary. A stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality, but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious. &#151; Dave Kehr",8102,1

The clerk goes to find a bottle and is killed during a hold-up attempt. John survives the robbery, but his complacency is left in shambles. In trying to make sense of the crossroads he finds himself at, John begins quite literally to inhabit the dead clerk's life and abandon his own. Despite the potential of the material, there is little action to accompany it. In fact, there's so little going on in &quot;Auggie Rose&quot; that the movie begins to feel like a coffeehouse conversation about a movie that's all about meanings and motif rather than substance and characters. – Elvis Mitchell",8120,1

"Set in a Jules Verne world beneath the earth's surface  in an incalculably ancient pyramid buried 2,000 feet beneath the Antarctic ice cap,  Paul W.H. Anderson's film imagines an apocalyptic conflict between two of 20th-Century Fox's franchise monsters, on loan from &quot;Alien&quot; (1979) and &quot;Predator&quot; (1986).  The humans don't have much to do in &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; but put the plot in motion and stand back to watch it work, a precarious position that eventually claims most of them.  Though Mr. Anderson does have an idea for creating a rooting interest, it's too far-fetched even for fantasy, and the film turns into a cold but occasionally impressive special-effects extravaganza. — Dave Kehr",8123,1

A giant Bactrian camel, left behind by a traveling circus, is adopted by Zygmunt and Marysia Zawicki (Mr. Stuhr and Anna Dymna), a middle-aged, childless couple whose lives are both enriched and disrupted by the animal's presence. The camel, a slow-moving, deadpan metaphor, becomes the center of a civic scandal, and the movie, like many works of art that originated in Communist Eastern Europe, is both patently allegorical and teasingly oblique. — A.

"Woody Allen, blessedly declining to cast himself as the romantic lead, appears to have shaken off the tone-deafness and compulsiveness that have marred his last three pictures. While far from his best work, this slight, tart anti-romantic comedy has a loose, easy rhythm and an impressive number of funny lines and gags. Jason Biggs, who is perhaps a little too amiable for the job, plays the Woody Allen surrogate, a comedy writer named Jerry Falk who is saddled with a difficult manager (Danny  DeVito) and an impossible girlfriend, a would-be actress named Amanda (Christina Ricci). Amanda, a sexual dynamo and a manipulative head case, might have been an exercise in sour misogyny, but Ms. Ricci has a feral intelligence that turns her into a finely drawn comic monster. Mr. Allen himself appears as an older comedy writer who appoints himself Jerry's mentor. The character — paranoid, vengeful, bluntly anti-intellectual — is both the continuation of other Woody Allen characters and a rebuke to their needy, self-conscious, analytical approaches to life. — A.O.

An ultraviolent Parisian detective, Hubert (Jean Reno), who pines for a Japanese woman he loved nearly 20 years earlier, is summoned to Tokyo for her funeral, where he finds he's greeted by . . . the teenage daughter he never knew. There's more: she's a mod-punk brat who wants to hire a yakuza gang to kill the man she thinks abandoned her mother. The mom has left behind almost 200 million, not yen but dollars. And to top things off, she's made Hubert her heir and the executor of her will. Then, things really get complicated. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",8166,1

"One way to judge the relative quality of a horror movie is by examining its vision of hell. Just how original and how hellish is it? By that standard, Ernest Dickerson's Halloween- ready scream fest ranks high. Much of the movie is set in a sinister abandoned church-like structure that sticks out like a boiling excrescence in a blighted urban neighborhood. The vengeful spirit haunting the place is a former street hustler and neighborhood legend, Jimmy Bones (Snoop Dogg), who was murdered by his partners in the late 1970's after refusing to make a deal with a corrupt police officer. In exalting the very worst of humanity, &quot;Bones&quot; displays a special glee and an unusual density of scary imagery. – Stephen Holden",8170,1

Now, aided only by an anti-government rebel, Takashi (Hideaki Ito, the reigning Japanese heartthrob), she sets out to exact her revenge.  The film tries but doesn't quite succeed in blending a long-established Japanese genre, the spare, ritualistic samurai film, with the far more colorful and kinetic tradition of Chinese martial-arts movies. &#151; Dave Kehr",8176,1

Scrupulously following the dramatic formula, the characters, all in their early 30's, are soon sharing their most intimate secrets, their most bitter disappointments and their most desperate yearnings.

"&quot;Cure&quot; is about a glum police detective stalking a serial killer, with whom he starts to feel a mysterious and unsettling bond.

The director, Kiyoshi Kurosawa, has made a specialty of taking familiar genres and infusing them with strange emotions and troubling insights, and he turns the thriller into a vehicle for gloomy social criticism. Rather than resort to clever plot twists and reversals, Mr. Kurosawa constructs an elaborate psychological maze and then strands us in the middle of it. The final scene is a piece of cunning visual wit that makes you realize how artful and sneaky &quot;Cure&quot; has been beneath its clinical, deadpan surface.— A. O. Scott",8268,1

"Many of the elements in this picture about an Irish family living in New York —  picturesque poverty, an angelic, doomed black man, a dead child, a pair of cute, precocious daughters, a risky pregnancy toward the end —  seem to promise a sticky bath of shameless sentimentality. But instead, thanks to Jim  Sheridan's graceful, scrupulously sincere direction and the dry intelligence of his cast, &quot;In America&quot; is likely to pierce the defenses of all but the most dogmatically cynical viewers. The film, which Mr. Sheridan wrote with two of his daughters, is unabashedly personal, but he is too modest a filmmaker to turn his own experience into a lesson or a parable. From moment to moment, as it follows Johnny and Sarah Sullivan (Paddy Considine and Samantha Morton, both quietly terrific) through their daily struggles, the story feels small, almost anecdotal. But just as its tactful realism is adorned with a dusting of magic, its unassuming clarity hides an unexpected grandeur. It is the kind of movie that keeps growing in your mind long after you ve seen it, and its characters are so radiantly particular that they come, after a while, to seem like people you know. — A. O.

"Sometimes nonsense makes good sense. The latest remake of Jules Verne's 1873 globetrotting fantasy is a deliriously silly caper that goes out of its way to thumb its nose at logic. This swatch of epic slapstick, in which three madcap adventurers from London play beat-the-clock in a race to circle the earth, is really a silent comedy with spoken subtitles. What distinguishes this rendition from the nearly three-hour 1956 version, which won the Oscar for best picture, is the presence of that coiled human whirlwind Jackie Chan. As Passepartout, the loyal valet to the fanatical British inventor Phileas Fogg (Steve Coogan), Mr. Chan makes his entrance diving out of a window in a Keystone Kops-style chase. The whiz-bang set pieces in which he fends off teams of assailants in exotic locales are the movie's high points. The film's witty Rube Goldberg-worthy contraptions remind us that until today's high tech environment, machines used to be funny. It's refreshing and perhaps even useful to see a movie that shows how susceptible to breakdown they really are. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Kathy Bates put in amusing cameos. — Stephen Holden",8362,1

This project leads him to Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), an awkward 12-year-old with a depressive mother (Toni Collette).

The story, based on Nick Hornby's novel, is thoroughly sentimental, but the Weitz brothers bring it off with a light, knowing touch, and Mr. Grant has the wit to turn his charm against itself, emphasizing Will's caddish narcissism enough to make his maturation seem meaningful. — A.

The film, directed by Frieder Schlaich, is based on the true story of Otomo's flight after committing a violent crime and offers dramatic conjecture about the hours before his final encounter with the Stuttgart police. &quot;Otomo&quot; is a bleak and powerful work, one we probably need more than ever these days. – Elvis Mitchell",8462,1

She plays Elle  Woods, a Los Angeles sorority queen who follows her undeserving boyfriend to Harvard Law School, where she turns out not to be the  airhead everyone mistakes her for. Indeed,  Elle — not to mention Ms. Witherspoon —  seems a good deal smarter than the movie itself, which stumbles when it should accelerate  and turns gooey when it should be sharp. - A. O.

Part comedy, part caper film, this picaresque tale gently satirizes the sillier side of the swinging 60's. It is also a cat-and-mouse game in which Frank tries to elude Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), an earnest, fuddy-fuddy F.B.I. agent who finally catches up with him in France.

Unfortunately, though, Wayne Wang's film lacks the bite and fizz of those pictures: it's neither funny nor giddily romantic enough, in spite of Ms. Lopez's magnetism and the best efforts of some supporting players. Ralph Fiennes, as the wealthy would-be senator (and current New York State assemblyman) who is Ms. Lopez's love interest, seems too meek and fuddled for the part &#151; more Ralph Bellamy than Cary Grant.

"The quasi-Christian allegory by the Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier is certain to divide audiences into passionate champions and hissing naysayers. Mr. von Trier is a ruthless provocateur with the sensibility of a practical joker. The ensemble drama, filmed on a stage designed as a map, often suggests a long-winded Brechtian deconstruction of &quot;Our Town.&quot; As a  contemptuous, nose-thumbing expression of the director's misanthropy, especially his  anti-Americanism, the movie is relentlessly true to its hateful vision, which portrays the  ideal of embracing human community (and especially the cozy, cookie-baking dream of  small-town America) as a lie. The only true solidarity to be found in any group, it  proposes, is in xenophobic mob violence. Set during the Depression in the imaginary American town of Dogville, it reworks Mr. von Trier's favorite metaphor for human cruelty — the persecution and martyrdom of an innocent young woman (played by Ms. Kidman) — then subjects it to a transcendently nasty, vengeful twist. — Stephen Holden",8497,1

"As in their previous films, &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot; and &quot;Best in Show,&quot; Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy, his writing partner, present a group of sweetly self-deluded oddballs in pursuit of show business glory. Here, the large cast sends up the folk-music scene of the 1960's, some of whose fictitious leading lights — the lovey-dovey duo Mitch and Mickey, the hard-working Folksmen, and the appallingly upbeat New Main Street Singers — gather for a reunion at Town Hall in Manhattan. It has been noted that this trompe l'oeil satire ignores the political dimensions of American folk music, but Mr. Guest is so faithful to the world he has created that you can forgive any lapses with regard to the one that exists. Bad music has never sounded so good, and the film's deadpan sincerity — especially evident in Ms. O'Hara's performance as the disppointed Mickey — will make you clap your hands and sing along even as you are laughing your head off. — A.

The viewer wants Mr. Tuzman and Mr. Herman to succeed, but it is evident that  they don't have the tools to make govWorks thrive. The drama is in the interactions at the office, where an early crucial misstep costs the partners an important alliance. They fear that mistake will come back to haunt them. As the bad vibes mount, the camera remains, benignly recording the disaster. -- Elvis Mitchell",8501,1

"Last winter, when Christophe de Ponfilly's documentary was shown at the Film Society of Lincoln Center, it was hard to imagine a more urgently topical film. Its subject, Ahmed Shah Massoud, the Tajik commander who had, over more than 20 years, fought the Red Army and then the Taliban, was assassinated by Al Qaeda suicide bombers on Sept. 9, 2001, in a grisly prelude to the attacks on the United States two days later. In the war that followed, the United States and its allies routed Massoud's enemies, the Taliban, and put together a government led by his allies in the Northern Alliance — a posthumous and as yet perilously incomplete victory for the soldier known as the Lion of Panjshir. Mr. Ponfilly's film is of course no less relevant than it was a year ago. Indeed, its release should serve as a timely reminder that, even as our government trains its sights on Iraq, the hardships of Afghanistan, a country nearly obliterated by decades of war, persist. — A.

He has dreams of making a hot, personal movie &#151; his own life as a series of journal entries &#151; and is so self-obsessed that he's almost paralyzed by the real world. The film, Roman Coppola's directorial debut, has a pixilated spirit; the filmmaker splatters the scene with his love for the movies, comic books and music, and the movie vibrates with that affection. These elements are the building blocks of pop, and he uses a dry, sharp wit to delineate the story. — Elvis Mitchell",8524,1

As the film's images accumulate, the movie becomes a sustained and ultimately refreshing meditation on surrender to the idea of temporality.

"As they might have said in the old days, this sweeping historical romance, which begins like a war movie and ends like a western, is one heck of a classy picture — which is both its great virtue and its limitation. This latest holiday literary adaptation from Miramax has the usual trappings of prestige — an award-winning novel as its source, a parade of top-notch filmmaking and acting talent — but it also has touches of intelligence and humor that separate it from such lifeless offerings as &quot;Chocolat&quot; and &quot;The Cider House Rules.&quot; Nicole Kidman, playing an over-civilized preacher's daughter stranded on a North Carolina farm during the Civil War, has never been lovelier. Her unfiltered movie-star charisma makes the character both irresistible and a little unbelievable. Jude Law is her long-lost lover, a Confederate soldier trudging homeward and meeting up with a procession of Hollywood hillbillies along the way. Anthony Minghella's dour seriousness is mitigated by his evident love of pageantry and spectacle, and the movie, in the best old Hollywood tradition, adds up to a mountain of honest corn. It's far from a great movie, but it has enough great-movie touches — lovely scenery, a richly layered soundtrack, a handful of diverting secondary performances (notably Renée Zellwegger, as Ruby, Ms. Kidman's no-nonsense backwoods helpmeet, and Brendan Gleeson as Ruby's wayward, fiddle-playing father), a pair of attractive stars — to make you wish it were one. — A.

"There is so much to admire in Kathryn Bigelow's thriller that when the movie finally collapses on itself late in the game, it leaves you in the frustrating position of having to pick up its scattered pieces and assemble them as best you can. Those pieces are flung into the air during the movie's grand finale, an orgiastic rush of blood and water that folds together the film's two parallel stories, one set in the present, the other in 1873. The contemporary strand follows the sexual tensions among four passengers aboard a pleasure craft off the New Hampshire coast as they face down an approaching hurricane. The more coherent, historical strand remembers the ax murders of two young women, both Norwegian immigrants, in 1873. Although those stories are supposed to bounce off each other in stimulating ways, they never mesh. — Stephen Holden",8597,1

"The winner of the grand prize at the 2003 Venice Film Festival, &quot;The Return&quot; is the stunning feature film debut of Andrey Zvyagintsev, a 39-year-old Russian director who here renews the grand tradition of Russian cinematic mysticism epitomized by Andrei Tarkovsky.  With a storyline at once enigmatic and psychologically acute, the film draws on biblical motifs to tell a story of the brothers Vanya (Ivan Dobronravov) and Andrey (Vladimir Garin), adolescents who have grown up in a small, depressed town in the care of their mother (Natalia Vdovina), their father having disappeared sometime after Vanya's birth. Mr. Zvyagintsev creates a most moving tension between his massive, archetypical themes and the bristling specificity of his characters.  The film is at once highly naturalistic and dreamily abstract, playing out its mythic themes through vibrantly detailed characterizations (and remarkable performances by the entire cast).

"Rock music doesn't necessarily have to be sexually provocative, politically  challenging or intensely passionate to be good. Some of the best music from the nerd  sector of the rock world is content to be bouncy, witty, catchy and ironically thought-provoking. They Might Be Giants, the New York cult band, profiled in A. J. Schnack's  affectionate documentary, is the brainchild of John Flansburgh and John Linnell, grade-school chums from Lincoln, Mass., who formed the  Brooklyn-based Giants as a duo and expanded it into a quintet.  The movie is not the typical rock-band saga of glorious excess followed by a  chastening fall from grace and then a glimmer of redemption. A kind of do-it-yourself  manual for independent bands, it has the informal tone and structure of an illustrated  scrapbook with excerpts from concert and television performances, interwoven with  lighthearted testimonials by friends, supporters, collaborators and admirers, and witty  animation. &#151; Stephen Holden",8604,1

"Sue Brooks's film, a stretched-out short story about cultural misunderstanding set against the natural sublimity of the Australian wilderness, provides Toni Collette, who has distinguished herself in so many supporting roles, with an opportunity to display her range.  She plays Sandy, an ambitious and self-sufficient geologist sent to a remote desert surface mine to meet a visiting Japanese businessman (Gotaro Tsunashima). Inevitably, they find themselves stranded on a desolate, dusty stretch of road and, perhaps just as inevitably, the angry friction between them softens into romance. The unnerving emptiness of the Outback adds a dimension of menace and mystery, but &quot;Japanese Story&quot; is, ultimately, too thin for its length and too dependent on easy assumptions about its characters. It does, however, demonstrate that Ms. Collette is more than capable of carrying a movie, and leaves you hopeful that she will soon have another chance to do so. — A. O. Scott",8618,1

"In outline a nightmare comedy on the order of Martin Scorsese's &quot;After Hours,&quot; David Maquiling's film turns out to be a fable of initiation, grounded in the folk tales of its director's Filipino ancestors. The hero, who ought to be a young warrior, is instead a 24-year-old security guard, Jack Crawford (Marc Palmieri), who can never quite seem to get enough sleep. Maquiling creates an unusual and intriguing tone somewhere between sharp, deadpan comedy and a soft, dreamy surrealism. Perhaps too modestly for his own good, Maquiling doesn't proclaim his originality in capital letters. But it is clearly there, and it marks him as a young filmmaker to watch. &#151; Dave Kehr",8621,1

"Ang Lee's soulful film stars Chow Yun Fat as a wise martial arts master who does battle with a fierce young female fighter (the exquisite Zhang Ziyi) after she steals his legendary sword. The movie takes the action form, which often attacks the screen with energy and movement, and creates a placid surface that offers a new perspective and a spirituality not normally found in these pictures. In terms of action nothing much takes place for the first 10 minutes. That's so he can set up the incredibly complicated plot, which has as much romance, intrigue, free-wheeling action   —   and rousing silliness   —   as any five Hong Kong throw-down fests. This is no small feat, given the dizzying amount of exposition in these movies.  Outrageous plot pile-ons certainly take place in &quot;Tiger&quot;   —   a practice as ritualistic as having a martial arts master and student square off against each other, also a part of the picture. Fans of the genre will giggle with delight over the canny way Lee handles the intersections, and audiences new to these films will shudder with excitement. Lee puts things together artfully and stages this movie like a comedy of manners; it could be &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; with a body count. — Elvis Mitchell",8624,1

"The subject of Paul Hough's documentary is the middle-American phenomenon known as backyard wrestling, in which young men attempt to emulate the bloody high-jinks of professional wrestling using decidedly amateur means  — homemade rings, built out of mattresses and tarp; homemade weapons, usually involving barbed wire wrapped around a club or a board; and homemade gore, here created, as the professional wrestlers do, by cutting the forehead with hidden razor blades. &quot;The Backyard&quot; is often hard to watch, given the level of hideous mayhem that seems to be standard for these performances.  Though much of the violence is faked, there also appears to be a very high rate of masochism among the participants, as if backyard wrestling were the male symptom analogous to cutting or purging among girls.  It releases tension, but at a considerable price.  An astounding anthropological study of that strange tribe known as the American teenager. — Dave Kehr",8654,1

"Although a lot of tender care clearly went into the making of &quot;The Rising Place,&quot;  this misty-eyed Southern nostalgia piece, in treading the line between sappy and sanguine, winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand. Set mostly in the 1940's, the story is a series of flashbacks from the deathbed of gentle, wise Emily Hodge, known as Aunt  Millie (Alice Drummond), whose rebellious salad days growing up in the Mississippi Delta  are recounted. The catalyst for the magnolia-scented memories that flood the screen is the discovery by the dying woman's niece, Virginia Wilder (Frances Fisher), of a cache of old letters and photographs. The film's mood of nostalgic reverence suffocates most of the drama that unfolds.  And there's a lot of it, even if it barely resonates. — Stephen Holden",8714,1

The movie is also a barbed reflection on the great divide between secular  and ultra-orthodox Judaism in Israeli culture. If the performances are strong, the  digressive screenplay lacks focus and momentum and is too oblique to connect many of  the dots between its characters and their behavior.

She's the kind of dream that teenage guys — in other words, virus creators and Hong Kong action film fans —  have spent much time at the mouse trying to locate on search engines. Like the virus, Lynn is not what she immediately seems —  she's a hot breeze of an assassin dispatched to take out the company chairman, which she does in the film's high point. After the first 20 minutes, when the movie sinks into following Lynn and her equally hot sister, Sue (Zhao Wei), on their murderous missions, &quot;Close&quot; is mostly retrograde. Its compulsive action-packed narrative seems almost like a throwback to the 1980's Asian action films of Fredric Dannen's book &quot;Hong Kong Babylon.&quot; Those movies' appeal mystified the directors who wanted to break free of them. — Elvis Mitchell",8803,1

Jordan Bridges, a son of Beau Bridges, stars as Kevin Taylor, a downy gosling in his early 20's who arrives in Los Angeles looking to set the town afire with his original screenplay, but becomes disillusioned working as an office assistant for a thuggish producer (Dan Hedaya). Partly for fun and partly for revenge, he puts out a rumor about a hot new script that doesn't actually exist, and sits back to watch the bidding war ensue. &#151; Dave Kehr",8818,1

"The third film by the Polish brothers is an opaque, elliptical dream spun out of old and invented Americana. In the 1950's, a hydroelectric dam is about to wipe out the Montana town that gives the movie its name, and a grim squad of government agents must persuade the last remaining residents to leave. One of them, the only child left in the local orphanage, dreams that a band of angels has come to town, and he tries to persuade them to take him away with them. At least this is what seems to be happening. But the film declines to mark a clear boundary between dream and reality; instead it unfurls a series of overlapping, enigmatic stories into a quilt of homegrown surrealism and soft-focus spirituality. The wide Montana landscapes and strange Hopperesque interiors are lovely to behold, but while it is easy to admire the filmmakers' unique magic, it is harder to fall completely under their spell. — A.

"If there's a useful  lesson to be gained from studying the life and career of Imelda Marcos, the former first  lady of the Philippines, it is a demonstration that if you act like royalty and believe that in  fact you are royalty, the world will treat you as such. All it takes is ego, show business savvy and plenty of bald-faced chutzpah.  In this documentary portrait, spun around a  rare extended interview, Mrs. Marcos proudly refers to herself as a star and repeats the  words beauty, truth, and love so many times they become a kind of self-protective  mantra. Of those three words, beauty is by far the most important. As a personality study, &quot;Imelda&quot; is a devastating portrait of how power begets self-delusion. Beyond the   interview, the documentary is a straightforward, well-made biography of Mrs. Marcos  and the history of the Philippines since World War II that offers no fresh revelations. &#151; Stephen Holden",8873,1

"Since his 1980 documentary on the punk-rock movement, &quot;D.O.A.,&quot; Lech Kowalski has been the foremost chronicler of the punk generation's romantic myths and harsh realities. The musicians he has focused on in his rough, video-based documentaries include the Sex Pistols, Billy Idol, Richard Hell and Johnny Thunders, the last one a spectacularly suicidal junkie-rocker whose 20-year journey to death by overdose was detailed in Mr. Kowalski's &quot;Born to Lose: The Last Rock-and-Roll Movie&quot; (1999). Mr. Kowalski's new film, &quot;Hey Is Dee Dee Home,&quot; is a rueful, reflective companion piece to &quot;Born to Lose.&quot; Its subject is one of Mr. Thunders's collaborators and fellow addicts, Dee Dee Ramone, who died of a drug overdose in June 2002.   With songs like  &quot;I Wanna Be Sedated&quot; and &quot;Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue&quot; to his credit (he often wrote under his real name, Douglas Colvin), Mr. Ramone made no secret of his drug use, and he remains a leading example of that brand of self-destructive romantic revolt pioneered in the 19th century by the French poets Charles Baudelaire and Arthur Rimbaud. As extreme as  his behavior and music often were, Mr. Ramone also seemed to be a sympathetic and reasonably self-aware person, at least as he is captured here in a sobered-up, 1991 interview that Mr. Kowalski unearthed and placed at the center of this film. &#151; Dave Kehr",8879,1
"Shot on video, Terry M. West's horror film adopts the format of Robert Wise's 1963 &quot;The Haunting&quot;:  a group of paranormal researchers are invited to spend the night in a rambling old Victorian pile, known to be one of the hottest spots for paranormal activity on the East Coast.  Among the group is Erin Cooper (Jane Scarlett), a prim, virginal young woman who is a gifted medium.  While the male members of the team, wandering off down dank corridors, encounter vicious, scantily clad female spirits who seduce and then slaughter them, Erin remains on the trail of the building's ghostly original owner, a Satanist who doesn't seem to be entirely dead.  Heavily influenced by the graphic 1980's work of the Italian horror director Lucio Fulci, Mr. West delivers an effective combination of shock and suspense that should keep fans of the genre happily grossed-out. &#151; Dave Kehr",8880,1

Haley Joel Osment plays a robot programmed with the capacity to love who is sent to live with a couple grieving for their comatose, gravely ill son. The movie's three distinct sections reveal an unsettlingly plausible vision of the future, and explore a rich, complex set of emotions and ideas. Mr. Spielberg accomplishes the improbable feat of melding Kubrick's chilly, analytical style with his own warmer, needier sensibility, and the result is an exquisitely layered, complex movie — the riskiest, most ambiguous, most intellectually challenging fairy tale the director has made to date. — A.

"Don't be fooled by the title, which suggests yet another dopey, generic teenage comedy. This is a romantic farce for and about grownups, which rises above Nancy Meyers occasionally slack writing and direction thanks to its cast, in particular Diane Keaton, who manages to be awkward, valiant, indecisive and very sexy indeed. Her character, Erica Barry, is a divorced playwright whose daughter (Amanda Peet) is involved with Harry Sanborn (Jack Nicholson), a much older man who has never dated a woman over 30. After Harry suffers a heart attack in Erica's East Hampton beach house, she becomes his reluctant nurse, attracting the amorous attention of his doctor (Keanu Reeves). The film, a wry, knowing celebration of middle-age sexuality, is so funny in large part because it acknowledges the inevitability of hurt feelings. The loudest laughter may come when Ms. Keaton, having risked heartbreak and then succumbed to it, bursts into tears, and cries her way to an unlikely and satisfying triumph. — A. O. Scott",8899,1

The movie, a flashy montage, which jumps around in time and  alternates between color and black and white, lacks narrative cohesion.

The makers of &quot;Justifiable Homicide,&quot; a documentary about the case, suggest that the subsequent firings of the director of the review board and the investigators assigned to the Rosario-Vega case were a result of the Giuliani administration's desire to make the case go away.

The carefully ambiguous title of &quot;Dummy&quot; could refer equally to Adrien Brody's Steven, a painfully shy young man who, though now in his mid-20's, is still living with his squabbling parents (Jessica Walter and Rob Leibman) and his tragically unmarried older sister, Heidi (Illeana Douglas), or to the unnamed ventriloquist's dummy who is his alter ego and closest companion.    Speaking in a voice far more confident and commanding than Steven's own (Mr. Brody performs his own ventriloquism, and quite nicely), the dummy becomes everything Steven has wanted to be but could never become — an outspoken, independent adult.  Rehearsing obsessively with his little friend, Steven slowly emerges from his shell, enough to attempt the clumsy courtship of Lorena (Vera  Farmiga), his kind-faced counselor at the local unemployment office. The gentle childishness of the characters gives &quot;Dummy&quot; a genuine sweetness that unfortunately slips more than once into treacle. — Dave Kehr",9001,1

"It's the last thing you'd expect — that a film that functions as both a commentary on socialism and a film noir could be entirely compelling. That's the case for Li Yang's  &quot;Blind Shaft&quot; and the China-set story allows him to create a hybrid and convey his documentary experience, steadily adding more and more character detail until a dazzling shocker moment at its climax; it's as if someone had unearthed a nonfiction film made by Cornell Woolrich.  &quot;Shaft&quot; starts in a dilapidated mining complex, and the picture has the bleak, grinding atmosphere of a real-life look at underpaid, trapped miners doing their jobs; a spooky shot of an elevator descending into the mine rings true because it creates mood and, later, serves as metaphor. Initially, the picture is harsh and claustrophobic enough to make us expect we're going to have to endure a collapse that will strand the workers in the dark, hard-to-see environment. Eventually, there is a collapse —  but it occurs after one of the workers kills a man and flees the site. His partner makes a bogus claim against the mine owner, extorting a payoff over the death of his &quot;brother,&quot; who died in the avalanche. This is the life they lead, moving from one shabby mining operation to another, conjuring faked ID's and collecting on the death of a &quot;relative.&quot; They then burn through the money on whores and alcohol. The mine owners they bilk are just as heartless —  they'd rather throw money at the problem instead of have it investigated.  Because &quot;Shaft&quot; is directed with airtight ruthlessness, its relentless and tough-minded storytelling has a grueling precision. The film wrings humor out of the pettiness of its determined killers. Its brooding meticulousness, and lack of flourish, evokes an old-school B-picture before the genre was over-inflated — and sentimentalized — into big-budget doggerel here in the United States; &quot;Shaft&quot; could be set in one of those faded boomtowns outside of Las Vegas and guided by Sam Fuller. The wan, gray skies and omnipresent squalor give the movie the feel of a black and white film, though splashes of color filter through occasionally. When someone does get around to remaking &quot;Shaft&quot; — and the film deserves such revisiting — let's hope the new version doesn't implode from gooey or overstated emotion.  &quot;Shaft&quot; deftly swings to a spartan, engrossing climax, and the final twists spell out what the murderers are made of and the setting responsible for them in the first place: a true piece of film magic. — Elvis Mitchell",9014,1

"This visually dazzling thriller set in the extreme south of Italy during the summer gazes at the world through the eyes of Michele (Giuseppe Cristiano), a 10-year-old boy living with his little sister and parents in a tiny impoverished village. Adapted from Niccolò Ammaniti's lean, best-selling novel about a 1978 kidnapping, this coming-of-age tale methodically peels away Michele's protective blinders. One day he discovers and eventually befriends Filippo (Mattia Di Pierro), a half-blind, frighteningly disheveled boy his own age who is buried in a pit next to an abandoned house where Michele and his friends play daredevil games. Filippo turns out to have been kidnapped. Even after Michele's father (Dino Abbrescia) is revealed to be one of the kidnappers and the boy's innocence has been shattered, the movie refuses to go for cheap, vicious thrills and continues to view the adults through the curtain of Michele's trust. — Stephen Holden",9038,1

"Mike Mignola's &quot;Hellboy&quot; comics have a drizzly, musty gothic ambience. Guillermo del Toro has brought a similar woozy, disconcerting melancholy to his film adaptation, and his obvious affection and affinity  for that dankness alone would make &quot;Hellboy&quot; worth seeing. But Mr. del Toro lets loose with an all-American, vaudevillian rambunctiousness that makes the movie daffy, loose and lovable. The story is pretty complicated stuff: during World War II, Hitler sends a special squad, led by Rasputin (Karel Roden), to rend the dimensional bonds and obtain a creature that will give the edge to the Nazis. His conjuring leads to the emergence of an infant creature, red as sin, with a long tail, who falls into the hands of the Allies. The kindly British scientist Dr. Broom (John Hurt) tames the tiny scarlet devil with a Baby Ruth the size of a Bazooka. Adopted by Dr. Broom, Hellboy, with his huge stone-like left arm, grows up to be the go-to guy for the good doctor and the anti-apparition league known as the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense. What gives &quot;Hellboy&quot; squirmy, ferocious life is the environment that Mr. del Toro creates onscreen. It's this texture that he avidly lavishes on &quot;Hellboy&quot; that offers the kiss of distinction.  It's an elegant haunted house of a picture, with dread and yearning part of the eeriness. Ron Perlman's performance as Hellboy, and his mastery of bad-tempered volubility, makes the film a kind of screwball comedy version of the Thing from the Fantastic Four comics. Like any American comedy protagonist, he's always trying to explain himself and do what's right. That ambition is what gets him into trouble and is the truest definition of Hell. — Elvis Mitchell",9041,1

But their adaptation is plodding where the book is swift, and solemnly portentous without enough leavening wit.

Mr. Medem, whose &quot;Lovers of the Arctic Circle&quot; also seemed to fold in on itself, must feel that fractured narrative is the best way to tell the story of protagonists who are at a loss at disentangling their own lives. This makes &quot;Sex and Lucía&quot; both refreshing and confusing, the film equivalent of an ice cream headache. The abundant nudity and moist clinches of the movie  explain why &quot;sex&quot; is in the title, since it's almost the co-star of the film. But the director's affinity for sensuality and sumptuousness, though often superficial, is so intoxicating that our interest is piqued enough to follow him.  But the final destination, albeit eye-catching, is nowhere, and he gets there in no particular hurry. — Elvis Mitchell",9049,1

"This lumpy three-and-a-half-hour glob of Civil War history occupies a narrow but self-important cinematic genre that might be called American History Pageant. As it follows more than two years of Civil War strife, from early 1861 through 1863, the film sustains a tone of grave, high-minded seriousness. The movie is the prequel to &quot;Gettysburg,&quot; an even longer 1993 film overseen, as is this one, by Ted Turner. Both films were written and directed by Ronald F. Maxwell and adapted from a sequence of Civil War books begun by Michael Shaara. Although the two movies share the same epic ambitions and majestic visual sweep, something has gone terribly wrong in the decade separating them. &#151; Stephen Holden",9051,1

Teamed as best friends who travel from Michigan to Hollywood, these two young actors display an easygoing, screwball rapport as they dash around Tinseltown, wreaking ludicrous havoc. It's no surprise that Mr. Muniz and Ms. Bynes seem considerably smarter than the frantic knockabout comedy in which they find themselves trapped.

"In the old days, we knew him as the Incredible Hulk, but the only thing incredible about this version is that is was made by Ang Lee and James Schamus, the minds behind &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.&quot; The greatest failure of &quot;The Hulk&quot; is not the clumsy, ugly special effects. (As the angry green fellow hops through the desert, pursued by fighter jets, he looks more Claymation than computer-generated, and you half expect to see Wallace and Gromit in the cockpits.) Nor is it the witless writing or the hectic, inconsistent acting. Eric Bana's inertia is overcompensated by the trembling weepiness of Jennifer Connelly, who plays his soul mate, and the raving of Nick Nolte, as his dad, a mad scientist. These lapses would be forgivable if the filmmakers had found the right tone of pop seriousness to bring the hero and his story into focus. They seem to be at once taking the material too seriously and condescending to it, and they are too busy marveling at their own technique to make us care about the sufferings of the Hulk, who is finally not credible at all. — A.

The unlikely, complicated passion between Martin, the troubled illegitimate son of a wealthy industrialist, and Alice, a brittle violinist, unfolds against an equally complicated and sometimes overcrowded background of family secrets and shifting domestic alliances.

Although conservative critics accused Mr. Earle of being a Taliban sympathizer, it was  merely the latest in a string of songs written from the point of view of social pariahs.

"A tired, morose police detective is drawn into the tangled psychological  web of a vicious serial killer. Such is the wildly original premise of this grisly, by-the-numbers thriller from South Korea. Though it comes from halfway across the world, the movie, directed by Chang Youn-hyun, shows a desultory mastery of Hollywood clichés.  For some reason, the Seoul police department prefers to inspect crime scenes at night, in the pouring rain, and its ace investigators like to poke around in suspects' lairs alone and unarmed. There are enough plot twists to produce gaping plot holes — as if screenwriting were a form of macramé — and a parade of likely suspects who soon turn into victims. - A. O. Scott",9162,1

"David Spade's newest comedy, although funnier than &quot;Joe Dirt&quot; or &quot;Lost and Found,&quot; strains mightily to have its cake and eat it too. One moment, the story of a 1970's TV child star desperate to make a comeback is a cheery, if puerile satire of  showbusiness, the next it's a pandering family comedy oozing saccharine platitudes. Mr. Spade is hardly a comic live wire (he's no Jim Carrey). But he gets some farcical mileage out of this ridiculous tale of a jaded 35-year-old show-business veteran who hires a  middle-class family to give him the childhood he never had. — Stephen Holden",9169,1

The picture could be compared to the blurry, loamy romantic rush of Wong Kar-wai, who began his career as an action moviemaker and drifted into his own brand of potent and dissociative poetry.

"This wonderfully vibrant entertainment — surely one of the best comic-book movies ever — reminds us that being a superhero is not all fun and games. The first hour is a Pop Art chronicle of suffering and indignity, as poor Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) struggles with the loneliness and frustration of being an anonymous urban crime fighter. His powers are waning, he has lost the respect of the woman he loves, and even Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) seems a little disappointed in him. Meanwhile, a new supervillain, the tragic and terrifying Doc Ock (Mr. Molina), rampages through New York on mechanical arms with minds of their own. There is plenty of noise and color, and some so-so special effects, but the real thrill comes from Sam Raimi's devotion to his hero's complex, conflicted emotional life, and to the melancholy, grown-up love story that develops between Peter and MJ (Kirsten Dunst), who comes into her own as a strong and decisive character, while still fulfilling the traditional comic-book girlfriend duties of screaming, getting kidnapped and being rescued. — A.

"The Israeli filmmaker Amos Gitai is an acerbic social critic who likes to point fingers and pick at warts, and &quot;Alila,&quot; his acidly comic study of life in a flimsy Tel Aviv apartment complex, is a sour urban mosaic whose seedy characters, try as they might, can't get out of one another's faces. Their residence, jerry-built in a dreary working-class section of Tel Aviv, is little more than a grubby housing development baking in the heat. Among the mostly unpleasant characters are Hezi, a secretive brute, and his besotted girlfriend. Another is a ruthless local builder whose sullen cream puff of a son deserts the army and hides out in the city's red-light district. Disgustedly observing the  chaos is a doddering, ill-tempered Holocaust survivor. The filmmaker's jaundiced view of humanity is matched by his eye for the ugly. &#151; Stephen Holden",9201,1

"This feature from the antiquarian avant-gardist Guy Maddin is a sublime, hallucinatory musical, full of surprising humor and genuine sorrow. Isabella Rossellini plays a legless Winnipeg beer baroness who, in the grim Depression year of 1933, announces a competition to determine which nation makes the most melancholy music. The musical numbers are wrapped around a plot involving sibling rivalry, national identity and loss, in which Mark McKinney, with a perpetual sneer and an Art Deco moustache, conspired against his father and his brother to win the big prize. Shot in grainy, ghostly black and white, with occasional splashes of color and an honestly heartbreaking score, this film, like Mr. Maddin's best work, is both a tribute to a movie past that never existed and a premonition of a seductive alternative future. — A.

Cook is Kimberly, who has foreseen, and escaped, a horrific traffic accident and is now similarly stalked. But death, which turns out to have a macabre and elaborate sense of humor, gets all the best material, and the filmmakers delight in staging a series of ghoulishly slapstick demises, involving pigeons and refrigerator magnets as well as the more traditional exploding cars and out-of-control elevators. The spirit of the movie is best summed up in the following line, spoken by a television news reporter after one such death. &quot;Ironically, the woman was impaled through the head after her airbag inflated.&quot; Ironically indeed. — A.

The film presents the great, short-lived British punk band in all its scabrous glory -- spewing obscenities on British television, spitting at journalists and fans and generally smashing through the drabness and hypocrisy of 1970's Britain like a brick through a shop window. At a time when every obscenity or aesthetic shock tactic feels like the product of either careful market research or dutiful graduate-school training, the filth and the fury of British punk rock at its moment of impact retains a surprising dignity. These guys hated everything, but at least they believed in something. Nihilism like this makes you glad to be alive. — A. O. Scott",9250,1

Later, John suddenly and inexplicably finds himself in Point Pleasant, W.Va., where, despite the town's name, strange things are happening. &quot;Mothman&quot; is about as threatening as the real-life insect the apparition resembles; its large, mossy wings may scare some people, but the bug can only damage your woolens. The movie flirts with more damage than it can actually cause. – Elvis Mitchell",9259,1

"Milcho Manchevski's stylized western is a potent, assured and ambitious piece of filmmaking brought down by weighted dialogue and a cast, playing Americans, that includes the British actors Adrian Lester and Joseph Fiennes, and the Australian David Wenham. This dazzling and dazed movie begins on the streets of New York, as a camera moseys down a street and then crawls up the side of a building, peering into several windows as various apartment dwellers play out their lives. It settles on a darkened room that Edge (Mr. Lester) has just broken into. He's prowling the apparently empty place for valuables, casting around and finding nothing but old photographs, some of which seem to date back to the beginning of the 20th century. He's surprised in his dirty work by the place's elderly inhabitant, Angela (Rosemary Murphy). He hits her, and before he can escape, she whips out a large antique — but still functional — six-shooter and proceeds to tell prattle on about her life. Her tale, unfolding in black and white and set in the Old West, finally ends up in Macedonia. It is the story of two brothers, the lusty outlaw Luke (Mr. Wenham) and his virtuous, religious brother Elijah (Mr. Fiennes). Mr. Manchevski suavely shuffles his various narrative, sometimes smoothly presenting the juxtaposed tales, and on other occasions, cutting violently from one of the stories to another. The literal violence — gun battles and punches detonating all of over both stories and leaving a spray of intentional confusion — happens to be staged with bracing clarity. The director signals that he's as unreliable a narrator as Angela, because what's more important than relaying facts in &quot;Dust&quot; is communicating emotion. It's a splintered-storytelling approach that Mr. Manchevski employed to insinuate the plot of his ingeniously realized &quot;Before the Rain,&quot; where the slivers of apparently haphazardly scattered plot points all came together. &quot;Dust&quot; lacks that film's central psychological underpinnings. Eventually, &quot;Dust&quot; is overly convenient and such an under-explained mystery that it never makes any sense. — Elvis Mitchell",9261,1

"One of the strengths of Hans Petter Moland's small, beautifully acted film is its refusal to give its characters' substance abuse the faintest patina of hipness. The movie follows the increasingly chaotic journey of Tomas (Stellan Skarsgard), an alcoholic retired Norwegian oil-rig worker, and his coke-snorting daughter, Kaisa (Lena Headey), from Oslo to the deathbed of his estranged wife, Helen (Charlotte Rampling), in Aberdeen, Scotland. Clenched and brooding, churning with rage and self-loathing, Tomas is one of the most realistic (and infuriating) drunks ever to reach the screen. Far from the lurching wild-eyed maniac of movie cliché, he is a furtive, cunning animal who grows meaner and more sullen the more booze he consumes. In a performance that matches Mr. Skarsgard's in depth, Ms. Headey's Kaisa is a high-strung chip off the old block. - Stephen Holden",9263,1

"Less a remake of than a full-scale re-engineering, this adaptation of Ira Levin's dry, efficient suburban gothic turns a dusty 70's thriller into a loud and shiny postmodern farce. The music, by David Arnold, is as dementedly campy as some of the performances, notably Glenn Close's as the robot matriarch of Stepford, Conn. Nicole Kidman plays Joanna Eberhart, a high-powered Manhattan television executive who retreats to Stepford after her career collapses and her marriage (to Matthew Broderick) threatens to do the same. Once there, she discovers that the town's women have all been turned into busty, cheerful automatons who exist to fulfill their husbands' every wish. The screenwriter Paul Rudnick's gags and one-liners are often sly and incisive, but the movie never lives up to its satiric potential, collapsing at the end into incoherence and wishy-washy, have-it-all sentimentality. — A.

But on reflection it proves to be an investigation, at once lucid and enigmatic, of exile, loneliness and the fragile possibility of friendship. - A. O. Scott",9342,1

"In this  moody, chiaroscuro character piece, Diego Lerman uses the title to comment on the changes that swarm over the three teenaged girls at the center of his myth-adventures.  But actually, nothing takes place suddenly, because he creates an intimate power play to contradict the jagged sharpness of the material. &quot;Suddenly&quot; was filmed in a stark, rough black-and-white style that grabs your sympathy immediately. We're introduced to Mao and Lenin, the tough girls who roll around the streets with the garish, crass charisma of screen stars. It's as if they'd emerged right out of a graduate student thesis film on Jean-Luc Godard. We catch them through the eyes of Marcia (Tatiana Saphir), a chubby, sweet-faced woman roughly their age who works in a lingerie shop; she regards them wistfully, with a hint of envy, as if she were thumbing through the page of a magazine. When Mao and Lenin invade the store, sizing her up as they drop ridicule, &quot;Suddenly&quot; takes a quick jump. The movie isn't judgmental about size or appearance; it's more interested in slapping down the bourgeoisie. It's a relief, because their prey, with her rounded, pleasant features and slightly awkward gait, doesn't deserve to be humiliated. The Argentine director is at his best in displaying his talents when there is little or no dialogue, especially as the sexual axis shifts between the three girls. The stoic volatility of the opening 10 minutes drifts into another movie altogether, one where a tenderness develops between the threesome as they get to know one another. And you find yourself rooting for Mr. Lerman to pull off this whole direction. When &quot;Suddenly&quot; finds its soul in the last half-hour, the title begins to make an endearing sense. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",9356,1

"It is fun to have fun, but you have to know how. This vulgar, unimaginative adaptation of Dr. Seuss' first &quot;I Can Read&quot; book is a compendium of how not to. Mike Myers, as the anarchic feline, has the manner of a Borscht belt comedian telling toilet jokes, and he helps to drag a great work of literature through a sewer of pandering, cynicism and crude sentimentality. Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning, as the two children whose dreary day at home is disrupted by the cat, are smart young actors, but they have little to do besides stand around and gawk, and then learn valuable lessons at the end. Parents tempted to expose their children to this bottom-feeding attempt to cash in on Dr. Seuss' reputation should heed the advice of the skeptical fish: &quot;Make that cat go away. Tell that cat in the hat you do not want to play.&quot; — A. O. Scott",9368,1
African culture clash. Disappointing sequel to delightful comedy.,9369,1
"In this portentous, and quickly disappointing, thriller even a kid's birthday party is lighted like a beyond-the-grave spectacular, or a wedding in &quot;The Godfather.&quot; This illogical but juicy bad-vibe opening suggests that Nick Hamm is going to provide some handsomely mounted scares; the birthday party of 8-year-old Adam Duncan (Cameron Bright) is being held at night; you expect social workers to come in and lecture his parents, Paul (Greg Kinnear) and Jessie (Rebecca Romjin-Stamos). After Adam dies in a horrible accident, his grief-stricken parents are approached by the eminent genetic scientist Dr. Richard Wells (Robert De Niro) at the cemetery. Wells pounces on Paul and Jessie with his procedure to produce a perfect duplicate of the dead son from one of his cells. The script, by Mark Bomback, starts with such a good idea — parents devastated by the loss of a child offered a deal, getting an exact duplicate, that they're compelled to take — that you give &quot;Godsend&quot; the benefit of the doubt for much longer than it deserves. As the second Adam hits the age at which the original one died, he's consumed by nightmares, and the movie drops into its second-rate horror-movie flailings, and failings. — Elvis Mitchell",9370,1

"Neither as crazy as &quot;Old School&quot; nor as charming as &quot;Elf,&quot; this extended comedy sketch (written and directed by a former &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; head writer) will nonetheless satisfy, for now, the national hunger for Will Ferrell's special brand of goofiness. This time he plays Ron Burgundy, a San Diego newsman whose supremacy is threatened by the arrival of a woman (Christina Applegate) who becomes his rival, his love interest and, of course, his straight man. The movie's ideas are none too fresh — the crazy sideburns and ugly neckties of the 1970's will only yield so much hilarity — but there is a reasonably high quotient of funny jokes and off-the-wall, nutty gags, including a street fight among rival news teams as amusing for its movie-star cameos as for it brutal slapstick. — A.

"Jane Campion (&quot;The Piano,&quot; &quot;Holy Smoke,&quot; &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot;) is an inveterate navigator in the murkier zones of female sexuality, and &quot;In The Cut,&quot; adapted from Susanna Moore's novel, plots a hazardous nexus of dread, danger and desire. The camera, as it surveys the grimy streets and cramped apartments of lower Manhattan, trembles as if it were running a fever, and Dion Beebe's cinematography is jumpy and bleary-eyed. Meg Ryan, who has darkened her hair and suppressed all of her characteristic perkiness, plays Frannie, a writing teacher whose feverish love affair with a homicide detective (Mark Ruffalo) involves her in the search for a serial killer. The movie's association of female sexuality with mortal risk is potentially interesting, but the cooked-up, conventional serial killer plot smothers its suggestive nuances and makes the psychology of the two main characters, which might have been provocatively mysterious, seem as deliberately smudged as the film's visual style. — A.

"Young love — the old-fashioned kind that flourished before the age of the hook-up — has always been one of the most challenging emotions to portray on the screen with any specificity. Beyond the smooches, sighs and adoring glances, how do you convey the reality of a shared, private paradise? In the strongest scenes of the screen adaptation of Nicholas Sparks's treacly best seller, Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams break through the barrier to evoke high-strung, slightly crazed teenagers plunging headlong into first love. Against your better judgment, you root for them to beat the odds against them. The romantic drama, which spans six decades, is told in flashback as Duke (James Garner), a garrulous, ailing old codger in a comfortable nursing home, reads aloud excerpts of a love story to a woman (Gena Rowlands) suffering from Alzheimer's disease. As the movie seesaws between Seabrook, N.C., in the summer of 1940, when the young lovers in the story meet, and the present, it is deliberately (and annoyingly) coy as to who these oldsters might be. Gosh, could they be the same young couple, still in love, six decades later? — Stephen Holden",9400,1

"&quot;Forty-one years after they played their first note on a Motown record and three decades since they were all together, the Funk Brothers reunited in Detroit to play their music and tell their story,&quot; reads a title early in the director Paul Justman's documentary. It is a simple premise that this movie more than lives up to, falling back on the serene power of the Funk Brothers, the squadron of elite musicians heard laying down the rhythm — and the law — on Motown's greatest hits. This salute to the literally unsung and underrecognized  studio heroes of Motown is so good because it is one of those rare documentaries that combine information with  smashing entertainment. And it is one of the few nonfiction films that will have you walking out humming the score, if you're not running to the nearest store to buy Motown CD's. — Elvis Mitchell",9404,1

"The mildewed, rusted aroma that archaeologists get when opening a tomb is the same odor that will hit the nostrils of moviegoers attending this horror grudge-match torn from yesterday's screaming headlines. The movie, which pits Freddy Krueger against Jason Voorhees, is far more horrible than horrifying. The only way that &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; might really be any fun is if these two avengers from beyond the grave decided to team up and go after the cast of  &quot;American Wedding.&quot; This dumb, only intermittently — sometimes even intentionally — funny sequel asks the question that since almost everything else from the 1980's has come back, why not the cynosures of the &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; series and the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; movies. But people are also nostalgic for the world of four television networks, Macaulay Culkin and anti-trust legislation, too  — that doesn't mean they're coming back. The smirky sauciness of Kreuger (Robert Englund) at least gives audiences something to root for, or against. The real problem is that Jason is a nobody whose face has been hidden from view for 20 years. There probably won't be a sequel to &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; — a concept that first surfaced over a decade ago, when both franchises had a trace of, well, blood, left. But if there is a next one, maybe they can get a make-over from the Fab Five of &quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&quot;; both Freddy and Jason are so last century. — Elvis Mitchell",9451,1

"Whether or not &quot;The River&quot; is, as some critics have claimed, Tsai Ming-liang's masterpiece, it is an excellent introduction to his oblique narrative style, his favored themes and his careful, lyrical visual sensibility. The story, about three lonely people who turn out, as if unbeknownst to themselves, to be related, emerges slowly, with virtually no exposition and minimal dialogue through a series of long shots that are at once naturalistic and meticulously composed. The pace of &quot;The River&quot; is slow, and Mr. Tsai's minimal camera movement and deliberate editing may take some getting used to, especially in an era of hectic cutting and hand-held hyperactivity. But he is one of those filmmakers whose visions, once encountered, are hard to shake, a rare director who seems, even at this late date, to be reinventing the medium and rediscovering the world. &#151; A.

"Square, corny, but effective all the same, Randall Wallace's film — based on the book by Lt. Gen. Harold G. Moore, retired, and Joseph L. Galloway — chronicles a bloody three-day battle between the United States Seventh Cavalry and the North Vietnamese army in November 1965. The early part of the movie, which depicts the American soldiers at home with their loyal wives and cute kids, is almost unbearably hokey in its simplistic view of American innocence. The war sequences that follow — uncompromisingly brutal and solidly photographed and edited — offer an honest, clear-eyed picture of both military disaster and valor in combat. For all the violence, an air of calm, sad stoicism — embodied by Mel Gibson, who plays Moore with apt modesty and discipline — prevails. At the end, one feels the story has been honorably told, and that due tribute has been paid both to the American soldiers and their Vietnamese adversaries. – A. O. Scott",9582,1

But the stars, and Martin Brest, who has a decent record of competence (&quot;Beverly Hills Cop,&quot; &quot;Midnight Run,&quot; &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;), mess up just about everything. The picture  —  a drab, talky amalgam of &quot;Rain Man,&quot; &quot;Prizzi's Honor&quot; and &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; — is mostly dull and shapeless. But the torpor is leavened by some howlingly awful sexual repartee, and by the brief appearances of Christopher Walken and Al Pacino, called in as designated over-actors, and who are at least bad on purpose. — A.

"The scandalous life of the 19th-century French novelist George Sand seems to be an irresistible topic for movies. In this ardent, earnest costume drama (with costumes supplied by the noted couturier Christian LaCroix), Juliette Binoche follows in the footsteps of Merle Oberon and Judy Davis. Her Sand, whose long, tormented liaison with the poet Alfred de Musset (Benoit Magimel) is the focus of Diane Kurys's film, is a curiously vulnerable free spirit, and the actress's softness and warmth are often overshadowed by Mr. Magimel's manic blustering. The actors generate some impressive erotic heat, but as is often the case with movies about writers, the literary and political passions that make them worth attention in the first place don't quite make it to the screen. — A.

"In &quot;Dragon,&quot; Hannibal (the Cannibal) Lecter is played once again with relish &#151; and probably wasabi mayonnaise &#151; by Anthony Hopkins. But Lecter is such a huge presence at this point that he capsizes the picture's narrative, which is presumably a manhunt for a serial murderer other than Lecter. Lecter is in prison, but a killer is attacking families in their homes on a lunar cycle. The F.B.I. asks Will Graham (Edward Norton), a now retired agent, to help find him before the next full moon. So Graham asks Lecter for help. The best material in the picture is sparkling, drawing-room comedy, like the exchanges between Graham and Lecter. And there are gamey comic moments featuring Philip Seymour Hoffman as the tabloid reporter Freddy Lounds. But while Mr. Hopkins excels at Grand Guignol comic relief, it's tiresome because we've heard it all before. The entire picture is a third-generation Xerox copy: it's a thriller too timid to thrill. — Elvis Mitchell",9625,1

"John Woo directing a Philip K. Dick adaptation — that certainly sounds like the opposite of coal in the stocking. Or at least it might have sounded that way in 1990. Since then, Dick's posthumous legacy has suffered through movies like &quot;Impostor,&quot; and Mr. Woo made &quot;Windtalkers.&quot;  But their new meeting of temperaments is surprisingly adept, given that it's basically a dumb movie about smart people. This smooth but bland thriller may be the best we could possibly expect from such a collaboration, especially when Ben Affleck — an actor whose becalmed exterior reflects an inability to project an inner life — is added to the mix.  He plays Michael Jennings, a hotshot inventor who steals the ideas and properties of other corporations, and refines them for competitors. For legal reasons, Michael gets his mind wiped clean of the theft by a dangerous medical process that nearly boils his brain. This procedure also eliminates Michael's memory of the entire period he spent at work — all for a paycheck.  When a new, less dangerous procedure comes along — one that can safely do away with three years, instead of a few months — Michael is invited by an old friend to get involved in a project that could potentially change the world, and net Michael an eight-figure income. He will come out three years later with a larger bank balance and no idea of his accomplishments. It's here that the sleek, ascetic paranoia  that Dick triggered in his short story &quot;Paycheck&quot; surfaces: the invasion of the mind and soul. — Elvis Mitchell.",9629,1

"&quot;The government is like a mother. If a mother feeds poison to its own child, what is the child to do?&quot; says an Indian villager living near a clandestine nuclear test in Anand Patwardhan's adamant anti-war documentary. &quot;War and Peace&quot; is the Indian director's solemn, stirring perspective on the competitive chauvinism between India and Pakistan, which manifests itself as the long-term nuclear arms race that the countries bordering each other have been involved in. With the controversy surrounding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, there might not be a better time than the present for this documentary. The film gets going with a formative incident in both the director's life, and his country's: powerful black-and-white film of the events surrounding Mahatma Gandhi's assassination. The spiritual stain left by this murder, which Mr. Patwardhan mentions took place two years before his birth, is the starting point of this noteworthy, rigorously contentious film. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",9741,1

Though the movie arrives bedecked with 10 Israeli Oscars, including the accolades for best film, best director and best actress, it is no more than a sentimental little comedy, a contrivance perhaps only an arbitrary script's page and a missile's length away from visiting tragedy on the lives of its gallery of colorful characters. - Lawrence Van Gelder",9760,1

"Nine years after they parted, in Vienna, at the end of &quot;Before Sunrise,&quot;  Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) rediscover each other in Paris,  and relive their brief encounter. This time, it is even briefer: the film unfolds, without skipping a minute, in the hour or so before Jess must catch a plane home to New York, and all those minutes are filled with looping, self-conscious talk as the reunited lovers wander along the Seine.   Their intimacy is tinged with nostalgic regret. The airy sense of freedom   that they shared in their early 20's has given way to the resignation of adulthood, even as they meander toward a second chance. The liberating   sweetness of the earlier movie has mellowed into a saltier, sadder flavor, but Richard Linklater, one of our most literate and intelligent directors, has not talked himself out of the possibility of romance, and the movie's relaxed, discursive structure is dense with implied feeling and oblique drama. — A.

"Working from an adaptation of Mark Burden's account of a failed United States military mission in Mogadishu, Somalia, Ridley Scott achieves prodigious visual schemes; he's so gifted he seems to be inventing new colors on the spot. But his eye and the producer Jerry Bruckheimer's bluntness turn the material into an empty, muddled piece of high-contrast jingoism that leaves the Africans – and the Americans – so undifferentiated that it verges on racism. Sam Shepard plays the commander who smokes only to create atmosphere; his Montecristo No. 2's have as much character as the actors. – Elvis Mitchell",9786,1
"Will Ferrell, admired for his television impersonation of George W. Bush, plays Buddy the Elf, who is not really an elf, but an overgrown human child raised by elves. Buddy, who towers over the other residents of the North Pole (thanks to some ingeniously designed sets and clever camera angles), is lovable but inept; he has been accepted by the elves, and his adoptive father (Bob Newhart) dotes on him, but he still does not quite fit in. And so, following the timeworn adoptee-in-search-of-birth-parent storyline, Buddy sets out for New York, on a mission to find his roots and also to revive the faltering Christmas spirit of the notoriously cynical locals, who include his dad (James Caan) and an adorable department store pseudo-elf (Zooey Deschanel). Directed in relatively mellow, easy-going style by Jon Favreau, &quot;Elf&quot; is a charming, silly family Christmas movie more likely to spread real joy than migraine, indigestion and sugar shock. The movie succeeds because it at once restrains its sticky, gooey good cheer and wildly overdoes it. The restraint comes from the casting of two beloved old sitcom curmudgeons, Ed Asner and Mr. Newhart, as Santa and his chief Elf. The responsibility for overdoing it belongs to Mr. Ferrell, who seems poised to enter the million-dollar pop-culture doofus pantheon alongside Adam Sandler, Jim Carrey and Spongebob Squarepants. — A.

"&quot;What if you had the power to stop time?&quot; ask the advertisements for &quot;Clockstoppers,&quot; a science-fiction adventure tale from the movie division of Nickelodeon, the children's cable channel. To the film's intended audience of tweeners &#151; the newly identified demographic category that lies between fading childhood innocence and the full hormone rush of high adolescence &#151; the answer to that question would be as obvious at it is to the film's young hero, Zak (Jesse Bradford). The power to stop time is, of course, best used to impress girls. If &quot;Clockstoppers&quot; had been made for a slightly older audience, Zak's first stop would probably have been the girls' shower room.

"This epic, the first feature film made in the Inuit language, is not merely an interesting document from a far-off place; it is a masterpiece. Zacharias Kunuk's adaptation of an ancient folk-tale, which won the Camera d'Or for best first feature at last year's Cannes International Film Festival, is much more than an ethnographic curiosity. It is, by any standard, an extraordinary film, a work of narrative sweep and visual beauty that honors the history of the art form even as it extends its perspective. The story about a vendetta that threatens the happiness of the hero and the stability of his nomadic, seal-hunting clan, takes a while to establish itself, but it has the clarity and the power common to epics from the sagas of ancient Scandinavia to the westerns of the old Hollywood. Austere and violent, the movie is also touched by humor and sensuality, and full of unforgettable images of the blinding Arctic landscape. Mr. Kunuk and his cast have accomplished the remarkable feat of endowing his archetypal characters from with complicated psychological motives and responses. The combination of dramatic realism and archaic grandeur is irresistibly powerful. — A. O. Scott",9829,1

The movie lacks the satirical bite of its prototypes but has a strong plot and likable  performances by its stars, especially by Gandolfini, whose hit man is even more  tortured with self-doubt than the actor's more familiar alter ego, Tony Soprano. — Stephen Holden",9933,1

"&quot;I love the movies,&quot; says John (Terence Stamp) in the writer and director Yvan Attal's noisily enjoyable romantic comedy.  It's obvious that Mr. Attal, who also stars in the film, loves the movies, too; he has made a terrifically deft picture about the thick line that separates movie glamour from the real world, and the thin line between common sense and paranoia. John is co-starring with Yvan's actress-wife, Charlotte (Charlotte Gainsbourg), in a romantic drama. And Yvan, like most mortal men in such situations, is being nibbled alive by jealousy. There are certainly parallels to be drawn between &quot;Actress&quot; and Mr. Attal's real life. Off camera, he's actually married to his co-star, and the movie, presumably, must be partially a nightmare version of his own experience. — Elvis Mitchell",9964,1

"&quot;Beyond the Ocean&quot; is dour and bleak, yet this melodrama — which doesn't amount to much of anything — may stick with you. The director, Tony Pemberton, wanted to create a contemporary, poetic slice of life whose lineage includes the sober, sometimes meandering work of the British director Ken Loach. The film shifts from black-and-white sequences in Russian with English subtitles — it begins with one such scene, with the young Pitsee (Tatiana Kamina) fending off the advances of her uncle (Donovan Barton) — to color scenes in Manhattan, where the older Pitsee (Dasha Volga) has just arrived. Pregnant and at loose ends, she has come to America to be with Alex (Richard Nagel), the young Russian émigré who is the father of her baby. – Elvis Mitchell",9968,1

"The main reason to see this stately screen adaptation of Chekhov's masterpiece is Charlotte Rampling's extraordinary portrayal of Ranevskaya, the sentimental aristocrat who allows her debt-ridden family estate with its beautiful cherry orchard to slip through her fingers. Ms. Rampling gives a character typically played as a grand, dithering ninny a keen self-awareness that makes her immobility in the looming face of disaster all the more painful. Alan Bates is also wonderful as her ineffectual brother. Although not all of the rest of the casting is as on target, the film still delivers a quiet punch. &#151; Stephen Holden",9979,1

In the early 1950's, a small fishing village on the outskirts of Reykjavik is thrown into turmoil by the return of Freya (Margrit Vilhjalmsdsttir), a prodigal daughter who left the village to marry an American serviceman during the war.  She appears, husbandless and apparently at the end of her rope, on the doorstep of her grandfather, a bluff, hearty sea captain (Eyvindur Erlendsson who leads his life on his ship and leaves his household to the management of the five women in the family:  matronly Granny (Kristbjvrg Kjeld), the mildly retarded Ninna (Gudlaug Olafsdottir), the marriageable Dodo (Edda Bjorg Eyjolfsdottir) and the inevitable tart-tongued adolescent, Agga (Ugla Egilsdsttir).

"Donald Petrie's film, from a screenplay by Tom Schulman and a story by Doug Richardson, is a terminally mild attempt to revive the populist political comedy as pioneered by Frank Capra in the 1930's. A far-fetched plotline finds a former President of the United States (Gene Hackman) running for mayor of a small New England town against beloved local son and all-purpose handyman Ray Romano.  They're also competing for the affections of the local veterinarian, played by Maura Tierney.  The picture is oversupplied with excellent actors — also in the cast are Rip Torn as Cole's chief political advisor and Marcia Gay Harden as Cole's dedicated executive secretary — but undersupplied with wit and dramatic interest.  The immensely likable Mr. Romano (star of television's &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;) and the charmingly pouty Ms. Tierney (a regular on &quot;E. R.&quot;) make a lovely sitcom couple, and &quot;Mooseport&quot; could easily serve as a pilot for a new series, should they ever decide to abandon their current sinecures.  Mr. Hackman fills the role of special guest star, floating above and apart from the rest of the cast, descending occasionally for a verbal wrestling bout or a bit of broad slapstick. — Dave Kehr",10023,1

Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Mr. Smith), who inhabited roles on the periphery of Mr. Smith's previous films, get the spotlight here. The pair head for Hollywood to sabotage a movie project about their comic-book alter egos, the bong-powered Bluntman and Chronic, being turned into film heroes.  Mr. Smith gets off a number of good lines and there are some funny situations. The picture often plays like a stoner's combo plate of &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; and &quot;Son of Paleface,&quot; with scads of lamely staged parodies of movies, music and comics: it's a 14-year-old boy's dream. That doesn't make for much of a movie; it's more like a slide show with sound. With Matt Damon, Gus Van Sant (who's an incredibly bad actor) and the very game Ben Affleck all making fun of themselves. - Elvis Mitchell",10026,1

The lovers, both in their 60's when they meet, divorce their mates and enjoy a  brief idyll before the disease manifests itself. The final two-thirds of the film chronicles  the composer's deterioration, step by humiliating step, into a nearly vegetative state as his  new wife tries desperately to forestall the inevitable, nearly becoming unstrung in the  process. Although the performances by Mr. Wollter and Ms. Seldahl are strong and  workmanlike, their characters remain somewhat remote; an honorable but depressing  film. — Stephen Holden",10037,1

It's crystal clear where &quot;The Road to Love&quot; is headed after its first few minutes, and the feature, crudely shot with what seems to be an amateur video camera, has little to offer in the way of stylistic compensation.  But some interesting reporting enters around the edges of the familiar storyline, as Karim uncovers the complicated and often contradictory attitudes toward homosexuality in Islam. — Dave Kehr",10054,1
"Mike Hodges's new film — his ninth in 35 years — has much in common with his first, the legendary &quot;Get Carter.&quot; This time, Clive Owen plays Will, a self-exiled London underworld figure who returns home to avenge the death of his beloved younger brother (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), who killed himself after being raped by a prominent citizen (Malcolm McDowell). The movie runs more on mood than on plot or psychology: the motives of the characters are at once too obvious and too obscure, and the storytelling is willfully oblique. But mood is Mr. Hodges's specialty, and few directors create such finely shaded atmospheres of longing, dread and grief. His chilly elegance and Mr. Owen's morose precision are balanced by touches of eccentric humor and by the vulgar warmth of the supporting performers, especially Jamie Foreman as the dead man's best friend, who becomes Will's unlikely sidekick. — A.

"The Taipei director Tsai Ming-liang has managed to create an underplayed melodrama about family dynamics and dysfunction that harks back to the spare, unchecked heartache of Yasujiro Ozu. Mr. Tsai has devised a storytelling style here that's both a natural evolution of his previous filmmaking and his most fully realized directing to date, with scenes that also combine the seemingly disparate methods of Ozu, Robert Bresson and Jacques Tati. In finding his own way, Mr. Tsai sets loose shock waves of comedy, which both unleash a wave of euphoria in the audience and communicate the pleasure he gets from filmmaking. Yet the huge laughs don't come at the expense of the deeply moving scenario, which is reminiscent of a barely tapped genre, the absurdist melodrama. – Elvis Mitchell",10071,1

"This tart and often charming new comedy is a version of the heart-of-darkness teen social comedy &quot;Heathers&quot; for the tweener audience; it has the ambitious and cartoony dark side of a Disney Channel sitcom, with a lively and talented young cast headed by the cherubic Lindsay Lohan. The &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; writer and performer Tina Fey wrote the script and gives the material a stylized vitality. But it does add a be-yourself finale that, while standard for such movies, this picture doesn't quite seem to buy — it's the kind of bored manipulation you come to expect from the Plastics, the pack of hallway-shrewd and glamorous teen queens who rule, through subtle terror, the high school that Cady (Ms. Lohan) attends. It's her first brush with socialization, since Cady was home schooled by her zoologist parents, who raised their daughter while traveling in Africa. Since most of &quot;Girls&quot; consists of the outsider Cady observing the tribal rites of her new setting and laying it all out in narration, this movie is great home for the meticulous and ruthless deadpan that Ms. Fey has perfected for the satirical &quot;S.N.L.&quot; newscast. Though narrative cohesion isn't the strength of &quot;Girls&quot; — as a series of moments, it works better from scene to scene than as a whole — the intelligence shines in its understanding of contradictions. Scene by scene, you can't help but be impressed by &quot;Girls&quot;; it's like a group of sketches linked by theme, with some playing much better than others. But after a while, it does begin to seem like it has the easily diverted attention span of one of its archetypal high school kids — you feel a little like a scold for wanting it to buckle down and concentrate. — Elvis Mitchell",10111,1

Set in Nebraska, it focuses on a grimly taciturn farmer obsessed with his dead wife, and his two grown sons who have an edgy, competitive relationship.

There is no mythic superstructure to unravel, just a realistic portrait of contemporary farm folk living their lives in the shadow of a crisis. — Stephen Holden",10122,1

Oddly, the film backs away from its fantasy premise and turns into a typical European workplace drama, as the two women, having found jobs in an American-style supermarket, get involved in labor issues.

Hunched into the cowering posture of a gentle, abused animal, he conveys a mercurial blend of terror and childish glee. Mr. Harris is equally fine as the principled coach.

"Based on the true story of Michael Alig, the Peter Pan of the New York club kids of the 1980's, this familiar tale of big-city glamour and ruin is a stylish muddle. Alig's sorry tale, which culminated in the murder of a drug dealer, is narrated by his friend, James St. James (Seth Green), with an unconvincing mixture of dishiness and moralism. Macaulay Culkin, playing the charming, insecure Alig, gives a brave and earnest performance, but also a desperately awkward one. Mr. Green, as St. James, shows more flair, and also more control, but the story lurches and drifts as the filmmakers, Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato  (who also made a documentary about Alig), vacillate between the impulse to derive a lesson from this tawdry fable and a desire to maintain a hip, non-judgmental distance from the spectacle of young lives sacrificed on the altar of fabulousness. — A.

"Since her suicide in 1963 at the age of thirty, Sylvia Plath's life, her work, and her marriage to Ted Hughes have been the subject of endless argument, and Plath herself has become a quasi-allegorical figure — a feminist martyr and an icon of poetic misery. Christine Jeff's film is relatively even-handed in its treatment of Hughes (Daniel Craig) and turns its subject from a case study in literary pathology into the heroine of a modern literary opera. The film, shot in dark, over-saturated colors by John Toon, is itself oversaturated with feeling. Rather than try to explain Plath s death, or probe the roots of her poetry, Ms. Jeffs and Gwenyth Paltrow burrow deep into her personality, leaving its essential, unsettling mysteries intact. Ms. Paltrow is a vivid, passionate presence throughout the film — she is rarely off the screen — and she charts the jagged course of Plath's abbreviated adulthood with ardor and intelligence. The movie turns biography into melodrama, but it does so out of a fierce, fascinated loyalty to Plath, who after all did much the same thing in her best poems. — A. O. Scott",10150,1

"Doug Pray's dense, exhilarating documentary tracks the history of the creation of dance music through the rhythmic scratching and spontaneous mixing of sounds played on multiple turntables, portraying scratching as a rapidly evolving, rather insular art form.  As portrayed in the movie, scratching is as competitive as rapping, with which it is not to be confused, and the film visits more than one D.J. competition. The movie is, if anything, too conscientiously  encyclopedic. For all the sonic excitement generated, you eventually long for a broader view of the subculture than the perspectives of its leading lights. – Stephen Holden",10175,1
"This small, smart, off-kilter comedy has the cheek to present itself as &quot;The Graduate 2004,&quot; although its affectionate subversion of a popular classic also stamps it as &quot;The Anti-Graduate 2004.&quot; From its story of the waking up of an emotionally numbed young man (Zach Braff) to its editorial use of a contemporary pop soundtrack, the movie obsessively refers to that 1967 generational landmark. The New Jersey suburban landscape to which Andrew, Mr. Braff's 26-year-old alter ego, returns from self-imposed exile in Los Angeles is a universe apart from the lotus land where he has lived in for the last nine years in a chemical stupor. Because &quot;The Graduate&quot; established the stock vision of suburban alienation that has persisted through  &quot;American Beauty&quot; and beyond, you expect &quot;Garden State&quot; to uphold the cliché. Instead, it allows Andrew to discover some nuggets of spiritual gold in the East Coast wasteland he dreaded revisiting. As precocious filmmaking debuts tend to be, &quot;Garden State'' is too self-conscious by half, but its struggle to revitalize a cliché by turning it inside out is a worthy one. — Stephen Holden",10176,1

The movie plays head games as relentlessly as she pursues espionage and clashes with other corporate spies, played by Gina Gershon and Chloe Sevigny.

"It's probably fitting that portions of the Farrelly Brothers' chewy but minor comedy are set in a resort town during the winter — Martha's Vineyard —  like their first picture out of the toboggan chute, &quot;Dumb and Dumber.&quot; Both movies seem to come out of a taste-free zone partially inspired by Rankin/Bass, the animation studio responsible for holiday stop-motion, self-pity classics like &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.&quot; The Farrellys' creations — this time it's the conjoined 32-year-old twins Bob and Walt Tenor (Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear) —  reside happily on a landscape like the Island of Misfit Toys. Bob and Walt are conjoined country mouse and city mouse; the directors bring the double-sided motif closer together than ever before. Bob is happy slinging burgers, while Walt aspires to be an actor —  a successful one, that is. He's already the star of their hometown, where he has the lead in the one-man Truman Capote show &quot;Tru&quot;; some of the funniest stuff in &quot;Stuck on You&quot; involves the comparison of Robert Morse's version to Walt's. While Walt succeeds without really trying, Bob hides under his bangs and maintains an e-mail relationship with a girl he's been writing to for three years, and hasn't met. When Walt decides it's time for them to move to Hollywood, he convinces his younger brother by saying it's a chance for Bob to actually see his Internet honey in person. With &quot;You,&quot; the Farrelly Brothers have a big, steaming order to deliver; they have to compete with the legacy of their own bad taste, which they compensate for with a quality that some may find even more repellent —  sentimentality. It's a much funnier movie than the trailer would lead you to believe; it would almost have to be.

Each of the actors manages to find, within Mr. Kane's thin script, moments of complexity and feeling, as well as opportunities for sly hilarity. In its own modest, genial terms, the picture succeeds: it never wants to be more than charming and sweet, and it invites us to imagine London as a cozy, happy small town where coincidental encounters are everyday occurrences and muggers and their victims can put aside their misunderstandings and start dating. - A.

James (Siyabonga Melongisi Shibe), a devout young African Christian, is sent to Israel on a pilgrimage, but is taken for one of the many illegal migrants who come to that country looking for work. He winds up living in a cramped apartment with other immigrants, who are hired out for menial labor by a businessman named Shimi (Salim Daw). The contrast between James's guilelessness and the duplicity and corruption of Israeli society is a bit heavy-handed, as is the story of James's material rise and spiritual fall. But Mr. Shibe is a smart and subtle actor who draws you into his character's predicament, and at its best the film has the sad, generous glow of genuine humanism. &#151; A. O. Scott",10271,1

"&quot;I thought I'd outgrown this kind of behavior,&quot; Jim (Jason Biggs) says about halfway through this comedy, at which point you're likely to feel the same way. The sequel to &quot;American Pie&quot; and, even more pathetically, the sequel to &quot;American Pie 2,&quot; &quot;American Wedding&quot; struggles so hard to be tasteless that it's almost quaint. (Don't presume such a remark to be a compliment — you'll see better film on ponds.) &quot;Wedding&quot; is so reiterative that it suggests the kind of compulsive behavior that often requires psychiatric counseling. In &quot;Wedding,&quot; Jim has proposed to Michelle (Alyson Hannigan). Their friends show up to support the happy event  —  actually, his friends Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), since Michelle's friends were apparently able to slip out of whatever obligations that might have forced them to return for this picture. Morale seems to be so low on the set that the cast might as well be clearing away shelf space at Blockbuster for the eventual spot of dishonor &quot;Wedding&quot; will assume there. — Elvis Mitchell",10306,1

On its own terms, though, the movie succeeds in dramatizing Mr. Nash's mental illness and, to a lesser extent, his mathematical insights. Russell Crowe's performance is honest and focused, but the movie's conceptions of intellectual life and human character are ultimately so simplistic, so deeply mistrustful of the audience's intelligence that any chance for genuine insight is squandered. – A.

A recent — very recent — decision to have an American actor, Breckin Meyer, voice the lead instead of Mr. Benigni, who also stars as Pinocchio and was a co-writer of the screenplay, leaves you with the impression that Mr. Meyer was actually in the projection booth reading the script. That might account for the quality of the voice-overs, which are so sloppy you might feel as if you're watching a 1978 Hong Kong action picture: the dubbed mouths of the Italian cast are probably still moving an hour after the film is over. There must have been such a rush to get the prints into theaters for the nationwide opening that no one bothered to check the lip-synching. It's as if someone tried to hit a target with a can of paint. — Elvis Mitchell",10379,1

"A magnificent documentary about the life of Jean Dominique, a Haitian radio broadcaster who was, until his murder in 2000, a brave and tireless voice for democracy and human rights in that unlucky country. In part, the film is a chronicle of that bad luck, as Haiti alternates between chaos and authoritarianism, with glimmers of hope quickly giving way to compromise, corruption and violence. Jonathan Demme interviewed Mr. Dominique and his wife, Michelle Mortas, many times over the years, both in Haiti and during periods of exile in New York, and these conversations, along with Wyclef Jean's bubbling score, give &quot;The Agronomist&quot; a lively immediacy unusual in documentaries of its kind. By the end, you come not simply to admire Dominique; you want to count yourself, as Mr. Demme clearly does, among his friends. Unfortunately, you will also have a clear sense of his enemies, the gangsters and strongmen who have run Haiti, usually with American support, for most of its modern history. — A. O. Scott",10381,1

"This action-comedy heist film is amusingly gamy, an anecdotal crime film that's an antidote to the pile of overly slick robbery pictures of the last few years. Unlike such gaudy, gleaming toys, in which the hoods have access to so many devices and fleets of automobiles that you wonder why they couldn't just retire on what they're spending on pulling off the crimes, the Australian-based film is set in a trough of despair. It features a few tart rip-off scenes and a performance of back-alley bravura by Guy Pearce in the lead as Dale, the thinking-man's hood who is the oldest of the Twentyman brothers, three accomplished thieves who are just about to be set free on bail. Their lawyer, the scheming, perfectly exfoliated Frank (Robert Taylor), who's arranging their release, has also set up a bank job for them and turns against them by its end. The rest of the film involves the brothers' getting pulled into another robbery after getting out of the joint, and using it to plot their comeback. &quot;The Hard Word&quot; is a series of snatches and betrayals, with a couple of surprises that aren't terribly hard to figure out. But it has the asset of a grimy, slightly mildewy atmosphere — a believably dank ripeness that's reminiscent of the British crime films of the 1960's. — Elvis Mitchell",10414,1

"The 16-year-old title character of this great, heartbreaking film by Lukas Moodysson, the Swedish director of &quot;Together,&quot; is a throwaway teenager abandoned by her mother in a grim, unidentified town somewhere in  the former Soviet Union. The tale of this vulnerable, credulous teenager, who prays earnestly to a cheap painting of an angel cradling a child, is a variation on countless true stories that have come out of Eastern Europe since the fall of Communism. Lilya is tricked into a life of forced prostitution in another country (in this case, Sweden) by gangsters posing as prospective employers. The film's most remarkable achievement is its presentation of Lilya's story as both an archetypal case study and a personal drama whose spunky central character you  come to care about so deeply that at each step toward her ruination you want to cry out a  warning. — Stephen Holden",10416,1

"This film adaptation of Frances Mayes' best-selling memoir feels so schematic that only the depressed Frances (Diane Lane) is surprised by the events as they unfold. The story of self-discovery that Audrey Wells leads Frances, a writer, through is eminently superficial, though the director keeps the movie going with a steady, commanding hand. Ms. Lane initially gives Frances a calm and pleasant sunniness, though she is resigned to never finishing her book.  She's attending a book signing early in the movie when she learns of her husband's philandering. When her best friend gives Frances a ticket to Tuscany, she grabs it. The trip is supposed to be pressure-free for Frances — it's a gay tour of Italy. She finds a new love anyway: a villa, Bramasole, that she buys on the spur of the moment.  But Tuscany is not the soul-saver that Frances hopes for: the house's promises of romance and a new life in Italy don't burst into bloom like the sunflowers that are often in view. The lesson of &quot;Sun&quot; is that Frances needs to look closer at the big picture, and her avoidance of that raises questions about how perceptive a critic she must have been. Eventually, the movie feels Frances has suffered enough and slaps on a happy ending like a Post-it note, but it's not earned. — Elvis Mitchell",10461,1

"When this comedy-concert film gives Eddie Griffin a chance to step out of the bag that has become a package of sure-fire, guffaw-forcing clichés for African-American comedians, it's worth paying attention to. &quot;Family&quot; follows Mr. Griffin to his Kansas City, Mo., home and spends a little time with his mother and two of his colorful uncles.  George Gallo intersperses interview clips of Mr. Griffin's family with a documentary taping of the comedian's stand-up act. The intent of the footage of the relatives seems to be an attempt to position &quot;Family&quot; as more than just a concert film. This is a better idea than the illustrative sound effects ladled over Mr. Griffin's act; he's hardly so subtle that his routines scream for embellishment. In &quot;Family,&quot; Mr. Gallo doesn't use much of the offstage material, which is too bad; it's just the right approach to offer insight into a stand-up like Mr. Griffin, whose cockiness is a dare, part arrogance and part fear. When his act gets interesting, he's drawing lines that he has to force himself to cross. His best material is autobiographical, like his assessment of Holy-Roller church services: &quot;Church is a concert for old people who don't get out too much.&quot; (The high-firepower profanity of his act will probably send quite a few people to church.) Caught by his own jokes, he cackles in a high-pitched whisper, just like Michael Jackson, one of his idols.  When he's hard on himself, Mr. Griffin mines the funk in &quot;Dysfunktional Family.&quot; &#151; Elvis Mitchell",10472,1

Facing the outright hostility of the local politicians and the anger and suspicion of the parents, Melinda sets out to remake the system, and decides that the best way to motivate her students and their parents will be by entering her class in a regional singing contest, where triumph will mean validation of her hopes and reinforcement of her students' dreams.  Gil M. Portes's modest, appealing Filipino film does not shrink from the sentimental responsibilities of popular filmmaking in the third world, but neither does it back away from making a subtle, significant political statement.

The direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence, but for most of the film it's hard to tell who is chasing who or why.  His shortcomings as a craftsman have not prevented Mr. Miike from becoming a cult figure, which seems to prove that substance can indeed trump style, as long as that substance is sufficiently red and sticky. — Dave Kehr",10571,1

"Because Kei Kumai's loving minor-key enchantment has such a genteel, forlorn wooziness &#151; the picture is about the restorative power of love &#151;  it's hard to believe that the script comes from an unfilmed effort by Akira Kurosawa. Kurosawa was almost ruthlessly anti-sentimental and is not particularly celebrated for his female protagonists. Yet there's what feels like an idealized, late-in-life tenderness in this story of Edo Period prostitutes, particularly in the character O-Shin (Nagiko Tohno). O-Shin isn't just a hooker with a heart of gold &#151; she's all heart. Away from the brothels, she probably could pass for a young woman with a future; she doesn't have the hard-bitten sulkiness of her colleagues, principally Kikuno (Misa Shimizu), who dotes on O-Shin but knows what a fool for love her friend is.  &quot;Sea&quot; rolls through the seasons &#151; all of them &#151; and Kurosawa's script treads the delicate line between conventional mortality and decency, as does much of his finest work. This material is simple nearly to the point of simple-mindedness, though. But the movie isn't dumb, although it is dismaying to learn that even Kurosawa had an unfilmed script romanticizing hookers' need for love. O-Shin isn't treated as a bashful novice.  Fortunately Mr. Kumai, who himself has shown no aversion to baroque melodrama, leans toward a plain and direct style that's tasteful and intelligent, a boon given the predictability of the story. We're lucky, too, because Ms. Shimizu's command of character has an astringent effect as well, which is needed. By the time the film's typhoon of a climax slams into view, &quot;The Sea Is Watching'' has made emotional waves of its own. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",10593,1

As an actor he has more dedication than skill, and as a director he does best when he is not pushing the story but rather sitting back to observe the banter of the players and the intricate, fast-paced physics of the table. — A.

When Lord Glenconner, the subject of Joseph Bullman's creepily fascinating documentary film, &quot;The Man Who Bought Mustique,&quot; turns his scorn on the residents of the tiny Caribbean island he once owned and then lost, you can feel your blood begin to freeze. And when he arrogantly tries to commandeer the movie being made about him, demanding reshoots to achieve a fake spontaneity and to cultivate a smoother screen image, you begin to understand why certain British monarchs were banished to the Tower of London. &#151; Stephen Holden",10638,1

"Frantically flapping their mouths like beached fish gulping the air on a polluted shore, the aspiring actors in this hilarious fake documentary are so thirsty for attention they confirm our lurking suspicions of the acting profession as a hotbed of whiny self-absorbed narcissists. Gazing with a jaundiced smirk at the scuffling world of aspiring New York actors, it locates the intersection of human vanity and show business aspiration and drives a spike deep into the center. Directed by Griffin Dunne from a script by Laura Kirk and Nat DeWolf, who costar, the movie deserves a place beside the comedies of Christopher Guest in the hall of fame of semi-deadpan spoofs. &#151; Stephen Holden",10651,1

"With the emotional sweep of a Verdi opera and the narrative density of a 19th-century novel, Luchino Visconti's &quot;Rocco and His Brothers&quot; represents the artistic apotheosis of Italian Neo-Realism. First released in 1960, the film tells the story of the Parondi family, migrants from southern Italy who go to Milan in search of a better life. In five chapters — one devoted to each brother — Visconti chronicles the family's changing fortunes, and in the process explores the transformation of Italian society as the children of dispossessed peasants become soldiers, criminals, sports heroes and industrial workers. &quot;Rocco and His Brothers&quot; lives on partly through the influence it has had on American filmmakers. Neither the neighborhood intimacy of &quot;Mean Streets&quot; nor the grandeur of the &quot;Godfather&quot; movies is imaginable without Visconti's example. — A. O. Scott",10661,1

"Not since &quot;Nashville&quot; or maybe even &quot;The Godfather&quot; has Hollywood turned out an epic as resonant as Steven Soderbergh's densely layered study of the Mexican drug trade and its devastating impact on the United States. In weaving together multiple stories, this intricate thriller, adapted from a British mini-series, jumps from Tijuana to Washington to San Diego to suburban Ohio. Michael Douglas is the new American drug czar, Catherine Zeta-Jones the ruthless wife of a busted drug lord and Benicio Del Toro a Mexican policeman. Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman are a team of government agents whose bust of a cynical midlevel dealer (Miguel Ferrer) precipitates much of the drama. Shot with hand-held cameras, &quot;Traffic&quot; builds into a profound and gloomy meditation on greed, violence and contemporary ennui. — Stephen Holden",10666,1

"Stephen (Greg Lauren) and Danny (Christopher Gartin) are a pair of model-handsome gay men, who live in a tastefully appointed townhouse on Stuyvesant Street.  They support their Cole Porter lifestyle by working, improbably, as cold-blooded enforcers for the mob. &quot;Friends and Family&quot; finds it hilarious that homosexuals can be as tough as any Bensonhurst leg-breaker, and the movie's central joke is that Stephen and Danny are much more efficient masters of violence than Vito (Daniel Mastrogiorgio) and Frankie (Lou Carbonneau), the two excessively gentle sons of the Mafia boss Don Patrizzi (Tony Lo Bianco).  But when Stephen's parents come to town for an unexpected visit, the two men must pose as cliché, mincing homosexuals who run a catering company.  The picture tries to crossbreed two popular subgenres of American farce &#151; the Mafia comedies epitomized by Harold Ramis's &quot;Analyze This&quot; (1999) and the long string of gay coming-out comedies that probably peaked around the time of Mike Nichols's &quot;Birdcage&quot; (1996).  But both strains turn out to be too exhausted to reproduce further, and &quot;Friends and Family&quot; quickly collapses into an overloaded, slow-moving series of predictable jokes and forced situations. &#151; Dave Kehr",10674,1

"Almost all the characters in this Almodóvarian romp observe the world with a dizzy, fun-house-mirror tunnel vision. Rosa María Sardà portrays a successful concert pianist, separated from her  husband, who announces she's gay and presents her much younger lover, a shy Czech  immigrant, to her three shocked daughters. The fizz of playful sexual anarchy bubbles  like spiked ginger ale through the comedy, whose two stars are veterans of recent Pedro  Almodóvar films. Caught by surprise, the daughters' dismay turns to hostility when she  tells them she gave her savings to her new lover. Convinced the younger woman is a gold digger, they scheme to destroy the relationship by seducing the Czech and proving she's unfaithful. The comedy doesn't waste any time setting its plot in motion. As it goes along, it picks up speed, and the final half hour ties up the loose ends with such haste that the movie's texture thins and the humor turns strained and eager to please. — Stephen Holden",10677,1

Like &quot;Trees Lounge,&quot; Buscemi's directorial debut, &quot;Animal Factory&quot; allows the characters to reveal themselves because they have nothing else to do with their time.

She hires Paul Angeli (Vincent Cassel), a mopey ex-convict with no qualifications, who is unlikely to threaten her position, such as it is. The two are soon embroiled in a psychological power struggle that threatens, oddly but convincingly, to turn into an office romance. Then, in its second half, &quot;Read My Lips&quot; mutates almost casually from a workplace comedy into a violent, clammy caper film. Like so many European pictures these days, &quot;Read My Lips&quot; seems destined to be remade in Hollywood, and it is unlikely to be improved by the addition of vainer actors, a simpler screenplay and flashier direction. &#151; A.

Because this Danish film follows the austere rules of the Danish filmmaking collective Dogma 95, it purveys a documentary-style realism that dilutes any lingering soap opera gloss.

"This Disney fright comedy, starring Eddie Murphy in another of his put-upon dad roles, is an anomaly - no frights and no laughs. The price of the popcorn-and drink combo at most theaters running this film is scarier. The titular entity is occupied by a ghost, Edward Gracey (Nathaniel Parker), who took his own life centuries ago in response to his lady love's suicide. Years later, the realtor Jim Evers (Mr. Murphy) is summoned to Gracey Manor with his wife, Sara (Marsha Thomason); tough-girl daughter, Megan (Aree Davis); and son, Michael (Marc John Jeffries). And the breathtaking Sara has an amazing resemblance to the late lady of the manor. &quot;Mansion&quot; is a movie that doesn't really want to evoke reaction - it lacks even the cheesy fear quotient that a film like &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy&quot; could dredge up. And Mr. Murphy is left to fall back on his mechanical sketch version of displaying terror, which only makes the picture seem even more insubstantial. — Elvis Mitchell",10822,1

The movie is a darkly funny exploration of American upper-crust malaise viewed through Igby's  merciless eyes, and Mr. Culkin's Igby, alternately smart-aleck and vulnerable, is pitch perfect. Susan Sarandon as his bitter, social-climbing mother, Ryan Phillippe as his yuppie  older brother and Jeff Goldbum as his shark of a godfather are almost as fine. The movie  suggests that as much of the chill of today's Darwinian social climate filters down the  ladder, it just as surely seeps upward. — Stephen Holden",10827,1

"The filmmaking team behind &quot;Shrek&quot; takes the bare bones of William Stieg's children's book about an ogre who thinks filthiness is next to godliness and uses that as a taking-off point for a new animated film that rejoices in its own brand of perversity. Shrek (voiced by Myers) just wants to be alone. If he can deliver Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) for Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) to marry, Farquaad will ensure that Shrek's swamp is restored to its isolated status. Much of &quot;Shrek&quot; is scrappy, brash comedy, and the brio of the actors adds to the dynamism. The movie is a giggly cocktail, though it's more foam than drink, a return to the frothy riffing on pop culture that started back on Bugs Bunny's watch in the Vitaphone days. -- Elvis Mitchell",10836,1
"Jehane Noujaim, working with the discipline and detachment of the finest vérité documentary-makers, traveled to the Middle East just as the United States was preparing to invade Iraq last year. Her focus is on the journalists working for the Al Jazeera satellite network, but her scope is much wider, as she explores the differences between Arab and Western journalists and the mix of tension and camaraderie between the journalists and the United States military officers trying to manage the flow of information. Through the deceptively simple practice of watching, listening and editing, Jehane Noujaim captures the complexity of reporting, and has a great deal to say about truth, democracy and the ambiguous status of the free press in the modern world. The current relevance of the film is obvious, but the skill of the filmmaker gives it a resonance beyond its topicality. — A. O. Scott",10837,1

"In the summer of 1970, a pair of Canadian rock promoters, Ken Walker and Thor Eaton, assembled an amazing list of performers for a five-day tour that would begin with a concert in Toronto and then travel by train to Winnipeg and Calgary.  The talent included Janis Joplin, the Grateful Dead, the Band and &#151; for the same now-mysterious reasons they turned up in Woodstock &#151; the oldies band Sha-Na-Na.   But because of a fight between the festival promoters and the producers of the movie, the footage was never edited and never seen.  It has now been reclaimed and cut into dynamic form by the music documentary specialist Bob Smeaton (&quot;The Genesis Songbook&quot;).   What Mr. Smeaton has created is, in effect, a brand new film from 1970.  Respecting the cinema-vérité style and technical limitations of the time (the grainy 16-millimeter film stock looks wonderfully like grainy 16-millimeter film stock), &quot;Festival Express&quot; seems to step directly out of its period, and is guaranteed to thrill both survivors of those times and younger viewers who may know little of them. &#151; Dave Kehr",10871,1

Directed by Frank Oz with a sure hand for ''Birdcage'' humor and written by the dependably hilarious Paul Rudnick, it skewers gay and straight stereotypes with the help of a fine supporting cast. Mr. Kline plays a small-town high school teacher shocked by the suggestion, made to a billion viewers of the Academy Awards show, that he is gay. Among those sent into shock by this thought are Joan Cusack as his alarmed fiancee, Debbie Reynolds in another wicked Mom role, and Wilford Brimley as the father who earnestly asks his son, ''Will you be goin' into show business?''

And years ago, while on a Fulbright grant to paint in Peru, he abandoned his mission, lived among the Amarakaire Indians and accompanied them on what turned out to be a raid on another tribe, which led him to an act of cannibalism. It is this act that serves as the springboard for an engaging and colorful but somewhat overbalanced documentary by a brother and sister team, David Shapiro and Laurie Gwen Shapiro. — Lawrence Van Gelder",10885,1

"When you hear that Campbell Scott is starring in Alan Rudolph's intensely appealing new domestic comedy, your first response may be, why not? With his furtive voice and fluttering diction, Mr. Scott nearly always sounds as if he's slipping information under an embassy door; the lines waft angrily around his mouth before disappearing and leaving a whispery trace. Dave Hurst, the dentist he plays, works hard to keep his messy domestic life in order while slaving away at a dental practice with his wife, Dana (Hope Davis), while murmuring about the existence he doesn't get to lead. Mr. Rudolph weaves a hilarious subtext  — the spoiled baby-boomer who refuses to relinquish his time in the spotlight  — into a home-life scenario. This notion of nurturing his inner infant keeps things ticking. Dave is suspicious of Dana, and slightly irritated at the three great daughters that he and Dane have raised. The movie depicts warring impulses that emerge in the scenes with Dave and his girls in a subtle, daffy way. — Elvis Mitchell",10896,1

A less lighthearted film might have portrayed Janice as a dangerous pathological liar. But this is a movie that so passionately believes in the value of what used to be called shopgirl fantasies that Janice emerges as a luminous independent spirit inside the dreary secretarial pool where she lands. Its giddy, upbeat philosophy insists that where there's imagination, there's hope, and Janice clearly has enough imagination for 10. &#151; Stephen Holden",10920,1

Birthday parties being in short supply, Will decides to augment his income by working the bachelor-party circuit. He invents a new character, a stubble-faced, transvestite clown named Vulgar.

"Michael Moore's latest documentary &#151; a rambling inquiry into the sources of violence and fear in American culture &#151; is tendentious and infuriating, full of ideological cheap shots and bullying interviews. It is also generous, disturbing, honest and funny. Since the subject, which sometimes seems to be nothing less than the nature of American society itself, is large and self-contradictory, it seems only fitting that the film (and the filmmaker) should share those attributes. The movie, populated by scapegoats, fools and striving, decent ordinary citizens &#151; in addition, of course, to Mr. Moore himself &#151; really does present an argument, but it should incite quite a few, which is not such a bad thing. — A.

"One way of looking at Raja Amari's sweetly upbeat  film might be to describe it as a Tunisian answer to &quot;Dirty Dancing.&quot; The story of a beautiful widowed seamstress from a proper family who rediscovers her sexuality through belly dancing has the same gung-ho vision of the swiveling body as a vehicle toward personal liberation as that sexy 80's hit. But because &quot;Satin Rouge&quot; is set in an Arab country, the social hurdles that the heroine, Lilia (Hiam Abbass), must overcome to achieve her self-discovery are much more formidable than the barriers of age and class dividing the lovers in &quot;Dirty Dancing.&quot; The movie, the first feature written and directed Ms. Amari, a Tunisian-born former belly dancer in her early 30's who studied filmmaking in France, is a feel-good feminist fable that in its quiet way is almost as giddily optimistic as &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; or &quot;Flashdance.&quot; &#151; Stephen Holden",11013,1

"Amélie (Audrey Tautou) works as a waitress in Paris and tinkers in the lives of her friends. When she falls in love with Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz), she can't be direct and let him know how she feels. Instead, she pulls him into an elaborate courtship dance that turns life in Paris into a game of Twister with a treasure hunt added to the mix. Nino trails after Amélie, still the mystery woman to him, as she leaves clues about herself everywhere. By the climax, the movie segues into a rumination on loss and the perils of being too playful. The film's original French title was &quot;Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain&quot; and the director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, deflates the self-mocking pomposity of the title by the last third of the movie. Yet there is no denying that &quot;Amélie&quot; is, to paraphrase its title, fabulous. – Elvis Mitchell",11017,1

He was in Nicaragua at the height of the contra war, in South Africa during the bloody mid-1980's and in Rwanda in the aftermath of the 1994 genocide. Mr. Frei's quiet, engrossing film is a sad and stirring testimony to this vision and to the quiet, self-effacing heroism with which Mr. Nachtwey has pursued it. — A. O. Scott",11028,1

The evidence posited by the experts has its own logic, though it leaves out the possibility that Shakespeare may have been a larcenous cobbler-together  of others' stories to which he added his own perspective. Nonetheless, this is an inviting piece of film. Mr. Rubbo's cast of characters have the charisma of true devotees and stoked egos that match their intentions. – Elvis Mitchell",11032,1

The movie observes the interactions of assorted desperate characters. One, a sadist and borderline necrophile (Jonas Bloch) is the film's most potent metaphor for the economic and spiritual malaise that suffuses the downscale world. Others include the flamingly effeminate hotel cook (Matheus Nachtergaele), the macho  butcher (Chico Diaz) for whom he pines, and the butcher's angelic wife (Leona Cavalli).  For all the misery on display, the characters emerge as robust, full-dimensional people in  touch with their own explosive feelings.

"This movie version of the 1980 United States Olympic hockey team's Cinderella season faces a hurdle that most fact-based films don't have to contemplate: the actual story the picture is based on was so corny and rousing that it hit all of the notes many filmmakers would have too much shame to embrace. Disney, the studio that brought us &quot;The Rookie&quot; and &quot;The Mighty Ducks&quot; (the movie and the team/merchandising operation), has no such restraint. Accordingly, &quot;Miracle&quot; does a yeoman's job of recycling the day-old dough that passes for its story. You can feel the film chafing against the restrictions given that many of the principals are still alive. The movie efficiently delivers the story points, though non-sports fans should be warned: the climax features an almost 20-minute re-creation of the penultimate 1980 game between the Americans and the Soviets. — Elvis Mitchell",11042,1

The movie is sublimely silly  &#151; as empty, elegant and beguiling as a magazine advertisement for an expensive watch &#151; but the director's evident pleasure, his impeccable CinemaScope compositions and the lush, suave score by Michel Legrand make it a seductive diversion. &#151; A.O.

Although the movies haven't lacked for Hamlets recently, Ethan Hawke and Kenneth Branagh being the latest stars to have weighed in, Mr. Scott's is something that must be seen.

"Based loosely on a children's fable written in 1968 by Ted Hughes, this film looks at the fearful years of the cold war through the politically correct lens of the 1990's. All this re-examination of the atmosphere of the post-Sputnik era is wrapped up in the story of a bright (and therefore unpopular) little boy who befriends a 50-foot-tall iron robot from who knows where that plunges into the sea one stormy night in 1957 and comes ashore near Rockwell, Me. The boy, Hogarth Hughes, saves the giant when it becomes entangled in high-tension wires, and the big lug becomes his secret playmate. Meanwhile, a nasty, paranoid Government agent is closing in on the giant, leading to a showdown with the military. &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; is a smooth, skilled example of animated filmmaking. Many parents will doubtless approve of the film's messages while they ponder how the passing years have smoothed the jagged edges of history. — Lawrence Van Gelder",11079,1

"Adam Rifkin's lurid and atmospheric film takes place in and around a filthy Los Angeles hotel, home to drunks, prostitutes, ex-convicts and, most poignantly, a forgotten tap-dance artist. Mr. Rifkin, who also wrote the screenplay, has a gift for creating the atmosphere of grimy despair his subject requires, and for leavening the grim proceedings with touches of grotesque humor. But the visual intensity and the relentless degradation visited on the characters begins to feel prurient and dishonest: the director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in their misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it. The problem, though, is not that he lacks the courage to contemplate futility and ruin, but that he's just a bit too eager. &#151; A. O. Scott",11127,1

"If there's one movie that ought to be studied by military and civilian leaders around the  world at this treacherous historical moment, it is Errol Morris's sober, beautifully edited  documentary portrait of the former U.S. Defense Secretary, Robert S. McNamara. Mr. McNamara, who was 85 when the interviews that make up the bulk of the film were conducted two years ago, served under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson in the 1960's  and has been widely vilified as a major architect of the Vietnam war. Subtitled &quot;Eleven Lessons of Robert S. McNamara,&quot; the movie organizes his hard-won observations into a  list of maxims about war and human error whose cumulative message suggests that  during wartime nobody really knows anything. The film, which has a solemn, anxious  score by Philip Glass, incorporates White House tapes of conversations about Vietnam  that Mr. McNamara had with both Presidents, along with vintage clips from World War II and Vietnam. — Stephen Holden",11184,1

"Lauren Lazin's documentary about the life and work of the rap star and actor Tupac Shakur is less a biography than a posthumous memoir, narrated by its subject — who was killed in a drive-by shooting in 1996 — from beyond the grave. Ms. Lazin uses audio and video clips, interviews, still photographs and handwritten lyrics to give Shakur the chance to reflect on his short, dramatic and remarkably productive life. &quot;This is my story,&quot; he says. &quot;Ambition, redemption, violence and love.&quot; There is also controversy, legal trouble, a difficult childhood and a some jail time — as well as snippets from Shakur's fresh, diverse and provocative music. As its title suggests, the movie is less concerned with analyzing Shakur than with bringing him back to life, for which his fans can only be grateful. For everyone else, this film provides the affecting, partial portrait — you might even say the self-portrait — of a talented young man (he was 25 when he died) whose fate was to be misunderstood, perhaps most tragically by himself. — A.

"The director Apichatpong Weerasethakul has devised a distinct kind of entertainment. Early on in this hybrid documentary, made in Thailand, a young woman who is not an actress relates a horrible incident. As she gets through the story, the off-camera director asks her a peculiar question: &quot;Now, do you have any other stories to tell us? It can be real or fiction.&quot; Whatever his agenda, Mr. Weerasethakul's odd request leads him across Thailand, where a cross section of people pick up the new story the girl invents and add their own details. &quot;Mysterious Object&quot; is similar to the exercise in which assorted writers each contribute a sentence, or sometimes a chapter, to build a single story. By traveling through Thailand's countryside to encourage townspeople to spin the narrative, the film offers a beguiling look into the country. – Elvis Mitchell",11258,1
Mr. Cusack plays an operative in this espionage thriller set in the 1940s.,11259,1
"Don't be put off by the vague, sitcom-ish title; this film is a true find, a picture with a vital daffiness that's all its own, rather that a film that lives on the leavings of other movies. The 16-year-old Victor (Victor Rasuk) is all teenage assertion, but his machismo has training wheels.  In Peter Sollett's delicate and altogether satisfying romantic comedy, it's Victor's puffed-rice pride that always gets him into trouble. Pride is a tricky subject to make a film about. Part of what will leave you taking in all of the delights of &quot;Vargas&quot; with open-mouthed wonder comes from the director's surefooted navigating of the way pride bounces around a small, packed household. Victor lives in a tiny apartment with his family, including his stubborn, salt-of-the-earth grandmother (Altagracia Guzman).  Things get complicated when Victor starts chasing the swan-like Judy (Judy Marte) and the whole world gets involved. In the larger world, this stuff might not add up to a hill of beans, but Mr. Sollett treats the emotional shifts in the Vargas household like the movement of tectonic plates; each change rocks the characters lives. — Elvis Mitchell",11260,1

"In &quot;Collateral,&quot; the edgy new thriller from the director Michael Mann, the city never sleeps, it doesn't even relax. Set in Los Angeles mostly after dark, after the city's sunshine has given way to cool noir, the story centers on a taxi driver, Max (Jamie Foxx), and the assassin, Vincent (Tom Cruise), who hops a ride with him deep into the night. Pitched between interludes of anxious intimacy and equally nerve-shredding set pieces, &quot;Collateral&quot; scores its points with underhand precision. The film is about a lot of different things, about how Los Angeles lights up even at night, how cars become prostheses of our selves and how driving with the radio on can be bliss. But as with all of Mr. Mann's movies, &quot;Collateral&quot; is finally about men and work, and about how being a man is itself a kind of job, which explains why this fastidiously crafted commercial film isn't just an entertainment, but a statement of personal faith. — Manohla Dargis",11274,1
"Beautifully handled drama of late-Victorian love, innocence and cruelty.",11275,1
"The impish Aki Kaurismaki, whose previous film was the black-and-white, silent &quot;Juha,&quot; fills this proletarian fable with music and color. The hero, a jowly, sad-faced welder (Markku Peltola), wakes up after a vicious mugging to find himself suffering from complete amnesia. But his state of dislocation turns out also to be a state of grace, as he finds friendship in a shipping-container shanty-town and love with a Salvation Army worker (Kati Outinen). The movie, with its easy, graceful humor and its plainspoken sense of decency, recalls the great populist films of the 1930's and early 40's: there are traces of Charlie Chaplin, Preston Sturges and Frank Capra in Mr. Kaurismaki's democractic aesthetic, and like them he has made a simple, poignant comedy whose intended audience is nothing less than the human race. — A.

In a Munich court in 1999 he was convicted of selling German nuclear technology to Iraq: specifically, appropriating the secret plans for an array of centrifuges used to produce weapons-grade uranium. Most of Mr. Schaab's story is told through his defense lawyers.  As the film cuts back and forth among Rio de Janeiro, Munich and Baghdad, with side trips to Zurich and elsewhere, it takes on the exotic coloration of a postwar espionage thriller, something the novelist Eric Ambler might have conceived on a tramp steamer crossing the Black Sea. &#151; Dave Kehr",11292,1

Toni Kalem's adaptation of an Anne Tyler novel is clearly a labor of great affection, but neither her sincerity nor the devotion of the actors can lift this movie above the soggy, moody cuteness that mars the writer's lesser work. The quirks of the characters are so doted on that your empathy is blocked, and you regard them as exasperating curiosities rather than as people with real lives and feelings. — A. O. Scott",11302,1

"To categorize Moufida Tlatli's film as a feminist critique of the subservient role of women in a traditional Islamic environment would be to understate the depth of anguish that this complicated portrait of an unhappy Tunisian family uncovers. The film follows two generations of women in the same family confronting a traditional code of behavior that is sharply at odds with the values of Western secular culture, images of which inevitably leak into the Arab world to sew confusion and rebellion. The movie isn't entirely despairing. Near the end, it suggests that contemporary Tunisian women with enough fighting spirit can achieve a measure of autonomy, although the personal cost may be bitter. And the movie's sun-drenched views of life on the southern Tunisian island of Jerba are beautiful. — Stephen Holden",11330,1

Val gets the job but when he starts filming, he comes down with a case of hysterical blindness and has to enlist  his agent, Al (Mark Rydell), to help.

Adrien Brody, in a fluid, understated and thoroughly unsentimental performance, plays Wladislaw Szpilman, a popular concert pianist who survived, against odds that can only be described as absurd, the German occupation of Warsaw and the inferno of the city's Jewish ghetto. With relentless clarity, Mr. Polanski tracks the deterioration of his hero's situation and the day-in, day-out assault on his humanity. There are scenes of unwatchable brutality as well as of kindness and solidarity, but what is most remarkable is the sense of daily life in impossible conditions. The last part of the movie, in which Szpilman is first trapped in a safe house and then condemned to wander the bombed-out city, is a tour de force, at once harrowing and strangely comic. — A. O.

Her current boyfriend, Hans (James Bowman), is an untrustworthy, narcissistic German model who likes to spend time in bed watching cartoons on cable television. In classic chick-flick style, Claudine is so hung up on the lumbering Hans that she doesn't appreciate the sweet, shy Jack (Musashi Alexander). Dazzled by the Aryan splendor of Hans, Claudine is blind to the more modest but more meaningful qualities that Jack possesses. It will take awhile — say, 90 minutes or so — before the error of her ways is revealed to her. — Dave Kehr",11363,1

Ms. Makhmalbaf's film, which won the grand jury prize at the 2000 Cannes International Film Festival, offers as bare and stripped down a picture of life at the subsistence level as Iranian cinema, known for its austerity, has ever presented. All the more remarkable is that the filmmaker, the daughter of the widely acclaimed Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf (&quot;Gabbeh,&quot; &quot;Kandahar&quot;), with whom she wrote the screenplay, was only 20 when she made &quot;Blackboards.&quot; It is her second film, following &quot;The Apple,&quot;  and it made her the youngest director ever to have an official selection at Cannes when it was screened  four years ago. — Stephen Holden",11375,1

The placid surface of Kim Ki Duk's lovely film is disturbed by eruptions of intense emotion, occasionally verging on melodrama, and by an intrusive soundtrack. But the film, with its moments of sharp humor (and the beguiling appearances of a white cat, a wry turtle and a quizzical rooster), is both sensual and austere, an exercise in spiritual discipline that sharpens your perception of human nature and the natural world. — A.

What's great fun about the film is that it is like a peek behind the Great Oz's curtain. And surprise! He's back there cackling up a storm. Actually, there are two of them: Dan Sonney and David Friedman, the pioneering hustlers who gleefully fleeced the moviegoing public from the 1930's through the 60's.

Mark Wahlberg, playing a Pittsburgh head-banger who unexpectedly lives out his fantasy of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, captures both the naivete and the passion of obsessive fandom. Though the story of his transformation from regular guy to metal god and back again is predictable and unconvincing, the movie is full of well-observed details and authentically awful music.

"The return of Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie), the swashbuckling archeologist and British peer who rose to digital stardom as the protagonist of a pioneering video game.  As directed by Jan De Bont (&quot;Speed&quot;), the picture quickly becomes just one more formulaic action film as the title character bounces around the globe in a deadly treasure hunt.  The object of her search is nothing less than the original Pandora's Box, revealed to be some sort of intergalactic surprise package that was once the source of all life on earth, but now contains the very essence of death and evil — a Weapon of Mass  Destruction if there ever was one.  Too many of the stunts are too obviously digitally enhanced to carry much sense of danger, and the film lopes from one set-piece to the next without developing any real rhythm or drive. — Dave Kehr",11583,1

Though the killings were written off at the time to a rivalry between the East Coast and West Coast schools of rap, Mr. Broomfield, not surprisingly, believes that more is there than meets the eye. Whether or not you buy Mr. Broomfield's findings, the film acquires an undeniable entertainment value as Mr. Broomfield continues to force himself on people and into situations that would make lesser men run for cover. &#151; Dave Kehr",11591,1

"A lighthearted, whimsical comedy about the blossoming of democracy in Iran must necessarily be either incredibly calculating or incredibly naïve.  But &quot;Secret Ballot,&quot; an Iranian feature from Babak Payami, is never clearly one or the other.  After seeing it twice, I'm still not sure whether the film is a canny piece of propaganda on behalf of the Iranian theocracy and the token democratic reforms that the mullahs have permitted, or if it is a work of stunningly sunny optimism that honestly believes genuine democracy is on its way to that beleaguered country. The landscape photography, by Farzad Jodat, is fully up to the high standards of the Iranian cinema, and there is always something pleasant to look at in the film. But whatever its political orientation, it is a very minor contribution to the great corpus of Iranian cinema that has emerged in the last 20 years. — Dave Kehr",11596,1

Unfolding like a brooding autobiographical epilogue to his stormier 1973 masterpiece, ''Scenes From a Marriage,'' it is a sophisticated ghost story in which a frail director (Erland Josephson) conjures the spirit of an actress he once loved and steps into the shoes of his younger self (Krister Henriksson) to relive their affair. That relationship broke up her marriage to a world-famous conductor (Thomas Hanzon) and devastated the couple's young daughter. The movie suggests that major life decisions with tragic consequences may ultimately come down to whims. &#151; Stephen Holden",11616,1

"A collaboration between the filmmakers John Greyson of Canada and Jack Lewis of South Africa, &quot;Proteus&quot; takes its title from the shape-shifting sea god of Greek mythology and its plot from the records of a 1735 trial.  Two prisoners held on South Africa's Robben Island, a Dutch sailor (Neil Sandilands) and a Hottentot tribesman (Rouxnet Brown), were accused of sodomy, and sentenced to death by drowning — a story that merges gender politics and imperialist practice into an ideologically meaty whole.  But as rich in ideas as the story may be, the filmmakers don't seem to trust their material.  They've gussied it up with fantasy sequences, flashbacks and literary allusions that distract from the dramatic core.

"The panic in the eyes of Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood), the barely teenaged protagonist of &quot;Thirteen,&quot; will stay with you for a very long time. &quot;Thirteen&quot; treats Tracy's behavior as a fever dream, something viral. This disease eating up her empathy and decency is what she picked up from the effortlessly cool Evie (Nikki Reed), who crashes into Tracy's life and plucks her from an existence of age-appropriate fixations like Barbie dolls. Evie, with the physical confidence of a much older girl, knows exactly how to devastate Tracy; she breezily drops hints that she thinks her new friend is immature. As Evie takes Tracy under her broken wing to remake her, we feel we're watching the protagonist of &quot;Thirteen&quot; undergo the initiations of a new tribe.  The closest  the film comes to a narrative is in following its young central figure straying into sex, drugs and alienation and her sudden detachment from her struggling single mother, Melanie (Holly  Hunter). What we recognize from the stricken look in Melanie's face is the same panic in Tracy's eyes — it's something mother and daughter share, and Ms. Hunter wills this spiritual match-up into existence. The movie has the ebb and flow that comes from material structured as a series of anecdotes —  it doesn't build, and sometimes it feels as cluttered as a 13-year-old's bedroom. But that may be a byproduct of Catherine Hardwicke's attempt to layer incidents that are as far as possible from the weary set of clichés that inform pictures about teens. Ms. Hardwicke, making her directorial debut, works from a screenplay she authored with Ms. Reed, shaped around autobiographical elements from the actress's own life. Usually, the protagonist is the bystander — in &quot;Thirteen,&quot; she's the fuse. — Elvis Mitchell",11708,1

"This listless movie adaptation, inspired by Alan Moore's imaginative and grisly take on Victorian heroes from his comics of the same name, has the sweat stains of wasted energy; it's drab, yet frantic. Convened to battle a world-threatening evil, the league is a group of tough, forgotten or ignored British loners brought together at the behest of the. The group is led by the legendary but aged hunter and explorer Allan Quatermain (Sean Connery), who, though well past his prime, is still capable of some world-beating moves. The other members include the pirate Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah); an invisible man, Rodney Skinner (Tony Curran, using his voice wickedly well); the vampire Mina Harker (Peta Wilson); the dandyish Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend); Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (Jason Flemyng); and the token American, an adult Tom Sawyer (Shane West), now an  operative for the United States Secret Service. Mr. Norrington shows glimmers of faith in Mr. Moore's melancholic and apocalyptic vision. Still, the movie suffers from its own anxiety: a dread of being too literate, if not too literary. That's an unintentionally hilarious failing, given the material's leaning on public domain book figures: in their way the Marvel comics heroes of their time. Somehow you sense that Fox would be happier calling this picture &quot;The <I>Justice</I> League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.&quot; As it stands, the movie is neither gentle nor extraordinary. — Elvis Mitchell",11769,1

But then the directing team behind &quot;I Will Survive,&quot; Alfonso Albacete and David Menkes, seem to have helped themselves to at least 10 years' worth of Hollywood chick flicks (and their British counterparts).

"Somewhere, audiences must be clamoring for remakes of violent mid-1970's American sports movies. How else to explain the nearly simultaneous appearances of the new &quot;Rollerball&quot; and &quot;Mean Machine,&quot; a British update of &quot;The Longest Yard,&quot; Robert Aldrich's 1974  prison football picture? At least &quot;Mean Machine&quot; refreshes the original by moving the action across the Atlantic, where football is actually played with the feet. The other cultural differences are easy enough to assimilate: instead of a warden, the British penitentiary has a  governor. Some of the slang is thick enough to require subtitles. (None are provided.) And while jail (or gaol, as the case may be) is a harsh and brutal place, to viewers of &quot;Oz&quot; it may look as benign as a progressive kindergarten. – A. O. Scott",11777,1
"After watching this fascinating and compelling documentary, you may forever wonder how it is that movies are made at all. &quot;Lost&quot; may not be a great piece of filmmaking, but it is a great story; its directors display dramatic intelligence. &quot;Lost&quot; is an inside view of how a film — in this case, Terry Gilliam's &quot;Man Who Killed Don Quixote&quot; —  can fall to pieces, even under the guidance of a master director. Imagine watching a real-life version of Ian McKellen's kindly, indomitable Gandalf in &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; give his life for his cause, only to find that his supreme gesture is meaningless because his fellows are slaughtered, anyway. That's what &quot;Lost&quot; is like. What's clear and astonishingly entertaining about &quot;Lost&quot; is that the directors' only good luck was that they happened to be safely behind the scenes when epic mishaps struck so often on the set that Beelzebub probably put in for overtime. — Elvis Mitchell",11778,1
"In his angry new comedy, Spike Lee carries his political exasperation beyond outrage into chaos. The carelessness with which the director hurls his feelings about hot-button topics onto the screen is the filmmaking equivalent of a last-ditch marketing:  grab everything in sight, roll it up into a big messy mud ball, and hurl it against the wall, hoping that something sticks. Lashing out in all directions, the director addresses white collar crime, the Bush administration, AIDS in Africa, the Mafia, Watergate, sex and reproduction, lesbianism and the meaning of family in a disoriented rant that lurches from one subject to the next with little to tie it together. A sex farce one minute, a crude political skit the next, an imitation &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; harangue the next, &quot;She Hate Me&quot; can't maintain its focus long enough to say anything fresh. The boilerplate polemics mouthed by stick figure characters sound like the beery 3 a.m. debates of a college bull session. &#151; Stephen Holden",11779,1

"From the German director of &quot;Run, Lola Run&quot; comes this chilly modern tale that re-examines the earlier movie's fascination with chance, coincidence and destiny but this time almost in slow motion.

"Although its tone is more dreamy than steamy, this film oddly seems a product from the same heated template as a William Inge or Tennessee Williams drama of the early 1950's. Its story of a handsome cosmopolitan doctor who revitalizes a provincial household with his charismatic vitality has a lot in  common with a period drama like Inge's &quot;Picnic,&quot; in which a magnetic, sexy stranger  jolts a sleepy Kansas town out of its postwar somnolence. Both &quot;Picnic&quot; and  &quot;Springtime in a Small Town&quot; reach their dramatic climaxes during a tipsy celebration during which inhibitions are lowered. At the same time, the film's deliberate pace and  delicate, pastel-shaded colors are wildly at odds with the sweaty torn-undershirt rawness  of its American cousins. And the film's postwar story of a family's awakening  becomes a metaphor for Chinese rebirth after Japanese invaders have left. — Stephen Holden",11820,1

But if the movie partakes of that formula, its combination of psychological insight and emotional restraint help it to transcend sentimentality. Michel Serrault plays a cranky entomologist who takes the neglected eight-year-old girl who lives upstairs on a field trip to the mountains in search of a rare Isabella butterfly.

"What is perhaps most exciting about Benoît Jacquot's film version of Puccini's &quot;Tosca&quot; is that, for the most part, it works beautifully as a movie without sacrificing the integrity of the opera. Mr. Jacquot occasionally interrupts the vivid, full-colored sensuality of the production he is filming to take us behind the scenes in a series of black-and-white documentary clips that show the singers and musicians, in street clothes and headphones, in a drab recording studio. While Antonio Pappano, leading the Orchestra and Chorus of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, conducts with much theatrical flair, these sequences seemed to me a failure of nerve on the director's part, an unnecessary reminder of the artifice that surrounded them. &#151; A.

In Allan Miller's documentary about their collaboration, much is made of the authenticity of the production, as though Puccini's work were being returned to the land of its origin, rather than the place where it happens to be set. &quot;Turandot&quot; is a story of passion, and passion surely motivated Mr. Mehta and Mr. Zhang to bring it to Beijing, but &quot;The Turandot Project&quot; inspires nothing more stirring than polite curiosity and restrained admiration. &#151; A.

Mr. Vereté, who spent seven years assembling this film, and who cast it with members of the Jahalin Bedouin tribe, sets up each story with a slow camera pan across this jagged, silent terrain. The inhospitability of the land emphasizes the spare precision of the narratives and helps to give them an atavistic power, as if they were tales that had been handed down since the beginning of time. – A.

She deserved better. – Elvis Mitchell",11937,1

Then Diz can go to a new school and reinvent himself from the ground up.  Diz emerges from Luther's counsel cooler, more mysterious: he's &quot;the new guy,&quot; whose prison record makes him more attractively dangerous. This bad-taste comedy does have a heart.

"Now that the Broadway  show &quot;Taboo&quot; has brought him a modicum of posthumous fame in the United States, the  reputation of Leigh Bowery, the Australian-born, London-based performance artist,  fashion designer and drag provocateur has finally crossed the Atlantic. In the 1980's,  Bowery was the toast of the London club scene where he elevated dressing outrageously  into a kind of a mad performance art. He later worked in galleries and sat for the painter  Lucian Freud.  This documentary, filmed in digital video, weaves interviews with  Bowery's strait-laced family, assorted art world personages and flamboyant playmates  into a detailed and affectionate biography. It gently makes the case for him as a  significant artistic catalyst who until his death in 1994 blazed a glittery trail at the  intersection of fashion, pop music, and surrealist performance. — Stephen Holden",11948,1

"&quot;The Singing Detective,&quot; Dennis Potter's 1986 mini-series, is the kind of television production that justifies the existence of the medium — a gloomy, episodic swirl of old pop music, film noir and psychological subtext that rewards repeated viewing. In the mind of its creator, it also deserved to be made again, as a feature film. Before his death in 1994, Potter wrote a screenplay that, in addition to abridging the original story, moved its action, and its cultural frame of reference, from England to Los Angeles, and from the 1940's to the 50's. Robert Downey Jr. plays Dan Dark, a pulp crime novelist suffering from a terrible skin ailment and a burgeoning inability to distinguish fantasy from reality. Helping him sort it all out is a kindly psychiatrist (Mel Gibson), who guides the audience through a flatly Freudian exercise in character analysis. But where are the characters? On its way to the big screen under Keith Gordon's clumsy, reverent direction, Potter's intricate, fascinating story has shrunk. The ideas that lurked in the mini-series shadows and alleyways are now placed squarely in the spotlight, where they look obvious and thin. The movie lurches when it should glide, shouts when it should whisper, and mumbles when it should sing. — A. O. Scott",11964,1

"Having starred in one of the most successful television sitcoms ever, Jerry Seinfeld decided to break into the small time, returning to the comedy clubs where he cut his teeth and trying to put together an entirely new act. Christian Charles's film, shot in grainy, low-light video, shows snippets of the comedian's act and provides glimpses of his offstage life, but its main concern is the professional culture of stand-up. In the company of his peers, Mr. Seinfeld reflects on the hard work and anxiety of his profession, and his efforts to keep his career going are contrasted with the struggle of a young comic named Orny Adams to start one. The movie is always engrossing, even if it is, inevitably, somewhat superficial. Not that there's anything wrong with that. — A. O. Scott",11966,1

This is, at bottom, a lesson in tolerance, but the atmosphere of unassuming realism and the tenderness of the two central performances make it less cloying then it might be, and Mr. Sharif's sly charisma almost rescues his character, who is basically the personification of exotic, enigmatic wisdom, from being a dubious Orientalist cliché. — A.

"This psychological mystery realizes that it is so lucky to have Cecilia Roth in the starring role that her character's name is repeated. &quot;Lucía, Lucía&quot; is such a vortex of plot that the movie begins to suck everything around it into a kind of black hole. It begins with Lucía narrating; she is about to board a plane with her husband, Ramón, for a Brazilian vacation. He disappears with the tickets as the flight is being announced. After the initial shock of her husband's broad-daylight vanishing wears off, she's forced to recognize that her marriage hadn't been a particularly happy one for some time. Ms. Roth's radiance and understanding of Lucía's emotional life gives this movie a touch of necessary psychological accessibility. Movies of this subgenre, in which the protagonist has to come to an understanding of herself by measuring her own life against her previous somnolent bourgeoisie existence, can feel vapid. This is partially because the star has to awaken from her own passivity before our very eyes. Ms. Roth makes Lucía's state a willful ignorance instead, and her emerging recognition of her unhappiness, as new information comes to light, adds a dimension to the material. The film also has two able, love-struck neighbors who lend her a couple of hands: Félix (Carlos Alvarez Novoa) &#151; a battered and elderly former political firebrand who still has a bit of a fuse left &#151; and Adrián (Kuno Becker), a 20-ish musician determined to prove his seriousness by quoting dense philosophical precepts at the most inopportune moments. Mr. Serrano stages his wobbly adaptation of Rosa Montero's novel &quot;La Hija del Canibal&quot; with lively, fast-moving efficiency.  Ms. Roth uses an anticipatory jitteriness, too, and gets to take a deep breath at the end of &quot;Lucía, Lucía.&quot; She deserves it, because she's kept the picture going. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",11980,1

"The most pertinent question posed by this high-minded, lethally dull biography of the legendary golfer Bobby Jones is whether a smidgen of the box-office magic of &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; has rubbed off  on its star, Jim Caviezel. The movie, which subscribes to the hero-as-masochist archetype, is as reverent in its awed, Sunday-school way as &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; is in its furious, gory way. Mr. Caviezel's bland impenetrability may fit the screenplay's portrayal of Jones as a ferocious competitor who internalized stress and suffered physically for it, but his muted presence fails to create a compelling character. The movie, which wants to ennoble golf with the same spiritual mystique that &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; brought to running, is even more hushed in tone than its prototype. But no amount of cinematic gloss (and symphonic musical uplift by James Horner) can cover up the fact that golf isn't an especially cinematic sport. &#151; Stephen Holden",12018,1

Campbell Scott plays a troubled mathematician who, with the help of Kate Winslet s dowdy file-clerk, tries to find his former girlfriend (Saffron Burrows), who has disappeared under suspicious circumstances. Much of the film is told in flashback, and so many subplots swirl about in the clammy English air that the concision and dramatic focus needed to make this historical thriller thrilling are never achieved. — A.

"Yale Strom's documentary wrestles with questions of Jewish identity in Poland, a nation where much of that heritage was destroyed during World War II. After all of the squirming and twisting, &quot;Street&quot; never secures a strong grip on its subject. The motivation behind the film seems to be that merely posing the question asked by one of the interview subjects &#151; &quot;Can you have Jewish life in Poland without Jews?&quot; &#151; is enough. That question comes up on several occasions, and the pain hangs in the air, inchoate and underdefined by the filmmaker. The movie is centered around the fact that Jewish culture has become a point of fascination for Poles, where Jewish cabaret is performed by gentiles. The film follows a &quot;Schindler's List&quot; tour of Poland, including Treblinka. &quot;Street&quot; mostly tracks a tour group that includes several American klezmer bands making a goodwill sweep through the country. They include the eager and happy Boston teenagers of the Klezmaniacs, bringing their sound to a land that has developed an appreciation for it. The movie obviously wants to demonstrate the oddity of the situation, but having someone reduce the Jewish experience to a vehicle for klezmer cheapens the case &quot;Street&quot; is trying to make; the audience members don't need to be sold on a subject they have already left their homes to see. Such an oversimplification seems ill-considered; it would be like saying the black experience in America could only be scored by the blues &#151; the type of patronizing remark that, once upon a time, people did make as a matter of course. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",12039,1

Rather than &quot;Spirited Away,&quot; the movie could better be considered the director Hayao Miyazaki's &quot;Through the Looking Glass.&quot; His specialty is taking a primal wish of kids, transporting them to a fantasyland and then marooning them there. The picture's theme is dislocation. That's what happens to little Chihiro (Daveigh Chase), who's trapped in a dream world not of her making. No one else conjures the phantasmagoric and shifting morality of dreams — that fascinating and frightening aspect of having something that seems to represent good become evil — in the way this master Japanese animator does. His movies are as much about moodiness as mood, and the prospect of animated figures not being what they seem — either spiritually or physically — heightens the tension. — Elvis Mitchell",12046,1

"Jonathan Demme, updating John Frankenheimer's classic exercise in cold war liberal paranoia, wisely treats the original as a touchstone, rather than a template, and his movie, in spite of some narrative flaws, stands on its own as a witty, anxious thriller for a new age of political uncertainty. Denzel Washington plays Ben Marco, a Gulf War veteran haunted by nightmares who tries at once to hold onto his sanity and to unravel a conspiracy that reaches the highest levels of corporate and political power. Liev Schreiber is a young congressman propelled toward the vice presidency by his monstrous mother, played with ice-chomping glee by Meryl Streep. The convolutions of the story are less important than the vigor of the performances, and the movie wears its attenuated political relevance lightly. Which may a good thing, since this &quot;Candidate&quot; is, in the end, a breathless and intricate thriller about the continuing need for campaign finance reform. — A. O. Scott",12120,1

One of his tenants is Lori (Eugenia Yuan), a sweet, girlish aspiring actress with whom Michael is secretly in love, but he is distracted by the aggressive, mysterious Darcy (Jacqueline Kim).  Like the French filmmaker Eric Rohmer, Eric Byler keeps his camera at a discreet distance from his actors, declining the easy emotional emphasis of close-ups in favor of the complex interaction of two actors sharing the same frame, communicating through glances and gestures rather than words. — Dave Kehr",12140,1

He feels misplaced until he discovers his ability to travel in time; it helps him make sense of his life. Sadly, the movie has no life, despite the admirable performances.

But he has nothing to celebrate: he's morose because he has found out that his girlfriend, Alison (Helen Dallimore), has been cheating on him.

Directed with anonymous pep by Les Mayfield, &quot;Outlaws&quot; is a dreary populist telling of the story of the James gang.

The two share a special bond, having lost their parents in a car  crash when they were children. Matthew Broderick is Sammy's stuffy new boss at the  bank where she works as a loan officer.

Set in the San Fernando Valley, &quot;A Cinderella Story&quot; strains to  bend the classic fairy tale to accommodate another coarse high school comedy of air-headed teenage vixens ganging up on a meek little angel. Samantha (the talent-challenged Ms. Duff), or &quot;Diner Girl,&quot; as she's jeeringly labeled, is a pariah because she drives a  battered old car and toils like a slave in her evil stepmother's hideous pink-painted diner.  That stepmother (Jennifer Coolidge), who suggests a nightmarish hybrid of Zsa Zsa  Gabor and Tammy Fay Bakker, is a greasy-looking sexpot manqué. The resident Prince  Charming (Chad Michael Murray) is the courtly captain of the football team, student  council president and closet poet, and the fairy godmother (Regina King) the salty, good-hearted African-American manager of the diner. Even for a fairy tale, &quot;A Cinderella  Story&quot; fails to make sense. — Stephen Holden",12293,1

"Andrew Jarecki has used American self-absorption as the heart of his engagingly evenhanded and intelligently assembled first feature. Essentially, that's what &quot;Capturing the Friedmans&quot; is all about, the American middle-class obsession of documenting innocuous daily life with eight-millimeter cameras and now videotape. Mr. Jarecki took film of a continuing tragedy and shrewdly wove the footage into a grim, watchable wormhole narrative about a family's decades-long tumble into a shattering pile of self-denial, lies and abuse. In the case of the Friedman family of Great Neck, on Long Island, the videotapes and eight-millimeter films say plenty. The amiable, deep bond between father and sons is tested when a child pornography scandal rocks their homes and lives. Mr. Jarceki so recognizes the archetypal figures in the Friedman home that he knows to push things any further through heavy-handed assessment would be redundant. This translates into an astonishing amount of confidence in his judgment. He layers the story, setting up his premise early in the film — that first impressions can't be trusted and that truth rests with each person telling the story. — Elvis Mitchell",12348,1

"This monotonously macho action-adventure film wears testosterone as if it were a new fragrance. The motorcycle-riding morons circle one another, hissing threats and flaring their nostrils as if they were about to lash their wrists together and break into a dance number reminiscent of Michael Jackson's &quot;Beat It&quot; video. They also do a lot of flexing and flashing of their tattoos — which look like wall appliqués for a particularly surly 6-year-old's bedroom — and seem to spend more time primping than Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie. Chief among these idiots is Ford (Martin Henderson), who's just returned from either a restful vacation in Thailand, or a flight there from his enemies. But he can't just ride around greater downtown Barstow on his bike or tune-up his misfiring relationship with his ex-girl Shane (Monet Mazur), a bike shop owner he abandoned. He's being stalked by the menacing motorcycle gang leader Henry  (Matt Schulze), who runs a lucrative crystal Meth business. Ford has possession of some of Henry's drugs and he wants his valuable stash returned, or else. Henry has worked the competing gang leader Trey's bandanna into a knot; he tried to persuade Trey (Ice Cube) into joining the drug business, but he refused. Henry kills Trey's little brother and frames Ford for the crime. Now, in addition to Henry's boys, the police and Trey's squad also are out to put their hands on Ford, who has to slip past all of them to get to Los Angeles. Why? So the film can show its true colors as a tribute to Walter Hill's haiku of a gang action classic, &quot;The Warriors,&quot; a movie that has less dialogue and far more wit than &quot;Torque.&quot; — Elvis Mitchell",12372,1

Anthony Hopkins is the agent who recruits Jake; the closest thing to wit in his performance is the way he intently chews gum while blowing away bad guys, terrorizing the always screaming Jake. The real suspense would come in asking why Mr. Rock would bother to star in a movie like this one. The movie has the whiff of something stale, like many of the non-political terrorist-as-villain spectaculars that have had their expiration dates changed since Sept. 11; it's not &quot;Bad Company&quot; so much as a bad movie. — Elvis Mitchell",12376,1

"Brad Anderson's supernatural thriller opens with a pair of working-class Bostonians, Phil (David Caruso) and his Scottish-born business partner, Gordon (Peter Mullan), making a bid on removing the asbestos from a huge, abandoned mental hospital. If Phil and Gordon had any common sense, they would put out a bid so high that they'd be laughed out of contention for the contract. But they don't, this being a horror movie and all, so they offer a low estimate and a promise to complete the difficult job in one short week. It seems likely that Mr. Anderson discovered his location before he conceived his story: the old hospital is a wonderfully photogenic place, full of picturesque rubble and odd spaces. It is the antithesis of the sterile, orderly hotel in Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film &quot;The Shining,&quot; though otherwise it seems to have the same insidious effect on its residents. But the film, too artfully conceived to deliver many overt shocks, often feels long and aimless. - Dave Kehr",12385,1

"This smart, acidic comedy by Nicole Holofcener, the director of &quot;Walking and Talking,&quot; could be described as a West  Coast answer to &quot;Sex and the City,&quot; minus that series' high-gloss glamour and erotic joie de  vivre. Catherine Keener and Emily Mortimer are sisters, both attractive and in their 30's, who  have major self-esteem problems and poor taste in men. Brenda Blethyn is their vain mother  who develops complications after surgery for liposuction. The movie zeroes in on  contemporary narcissism with a needling accuracy that illustrates exactly the  way some people allow their insecurities to poison their intimate relationships. But once  it has limned its characters (Ms. Keener's is by far the most vivid), it doesn't go  anywhere in particular. — Stephen Holden",12389,1

"After grueling workouts in &quot;Training Day&quot; — for which he won his first Best Actor Oscar —  and his directorial debut with &quot;Antwon Fisher,&quot; Denzel Washington is on cruise-control for this noir film. Although it's briskly directed and enjoyably stylized, &quot;Out of Time&quot; is shallow —  actually empty. Mr. Washington, as the small-town Florida police chief Matt Lee Whitlock, steals several hundred thousand dollars in seized drug money to pay for the experimental cancer therapy his mistress Ann Merai (Sanaa Lathan) needs. But when she and her jealous husband, Chris (Dean Cain), die in a fire —  and all the money mysteriously disappears, while Matt is left the beneficiary of Ann Merai's million-dollar insurance policy —  the clues point to Matt as the murderer. To make matters worse, Matt's estranged detective wife, Alex (Eva Mendes), is investigating the case. To further crank up Matt's adrenaline level as he's looking for evidence to clear himself, the feds want the drug money —  now. Mr. Washington plays the desperation well; it becomes Matt's defining characteristic. And Carl Franklin keeps &quot;Time&quot; breezy enough to fight the oppressive humidity that his cast is obviously laboring under in the Florida sun by keeping the proceedings buoyant. By the time Matt is fighting to hang onto a rapidly crumbling hotel balcony while battling a suspect, you realize that a functioning sense of humor is the classiest touch that a filmmaker could lend to the piled-on plot. — Elvis Mitchell",12404,1

A casual sexual encounter with her best friend (Bebe Neuwirth) over Thanksgiving break leads to an attempted cover-up that resembles a sophisticated French farce. Ms. Neuwirth practically steals the movie as the kindhearted but libidinous chiropractor with whom he enjoys a one-night stand.

"Ken Loach provides a sense of purpose to his compelling new social melodrama that leaves no room for sentimentality. Instead he propels the picture forward with a documentary sureness. The movie might seem rather perfunctory if it weren't teeming with life; the last scene is a particularly lumpen cliché. This picture remains indelible because of Mr. Loach's bold, direct framing of the narrative, and the casual dynamism of its young star, Martin Compston, making his acting debut. This slim, gawky kid takes to the camera with alarming ease, and makes acting seem as deceptively simple as the title of Mr. Loach's involving film. The romance comes from the character's passions, which include fighting to stay alive and keeping a light in his heart for his jailed mother, Jean (Michelle Coulter). Mr. Compston succeeds on the same levels as the film, which brings to mind the socially conscious melodramas of the 1930's from Warner Brothers. Several scenes also evoke François Truffaut's 1959 triumph, &quot;The 400 Blows,&quot; with its adolescent sense of doom and reckless,  unfocused energy. And as in Truffaut's film, subtitles are necessary to understand the heavily Scots-accented dialogue. — Elvis Mitchell",12448,1

"After &quot;The Crow&quot; and &quot;Dark City&quot;  — two movies in which even the lightest moments seemed to take place under a full moon partially obscured by a cloud bank — Alex Proyas returns to the world of geek cinema with this spry and wiry punk comedy. Bathed in the tangy candy colors of tropical fruit Starbursts, the movie follows the adventures of an aspiring band led by the ambitious, spiky-haired Freddy (Kick Gurry). The flabby, dimwit manager Bruno (the scene-stealing Russell Dykstra) wants to shove the group along the way, too.  Touchingly, Freddy's fantasy seems to be as out-of-touch as full-priced CD's and pre-recorded videocassettes, a notion he willingly admits. His best pal, Joe (Brett Stiller), professes to crave normality. But with a former rock-star dad, Kevin (Andy Anderson),  who still wears the poodle curls  and has a penchant for groupies with a taste for suicidal tendencies, Joe isn't fooling anyone.  The drummer, Lucy (Chris Sadrinna), gobbles his own homemade brew of pharmaceuticals and judges the results on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being a rapturous mixture of pleasure and pain he eventually experiences in a way that surprises even him. Tanya (Pia Miranda), the bassist, has the gaunt, dolorous manner of a sexy butch-pixie. Mr. Proyas, who often displays more technique than he knows what to do with, marries his compulsive exhibitionism to &quot;Garage&quot; in ways that suggest a visual exploration of pop culture wisecracking; this movie could be &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; as staged by the director Danny Boyle of &quot;Trainspotting.&quot; He gets the most gas out of &quot;Garage&quot; in set pieces that are departures from the pedestrian pursuit of stadium-filling popularity. The end itself may be a bit of a letdown, but much of &quot;Garage Days&quot; is choice cuts, indeed. — Elvis Mitchell",12476,1
"The title character of this short, lively spoof began his life as an Internet cartoon. As portrayed by Eddie Griffin, Undercover Brother, decked out in blaxploitation splendor with a mile-high afro and towering platform shoes, wages a heroic battle against The Man, who is not a metaphor for white power but an actual man. The satire is not altogether fresh, but the jokes are at once sufficiently clever and sufficiently silly to keep things moving, and to point up the ridiculousness of American racial politics. As one character remarks, &quot;It's a proud day for black people of all races.&quot; — A. O. Scott",12477,1
"Out of the Hollywood fantasyland of action without consequences comes the high mortality, low logic &quot;Knockaround Guys.&quot; Written and directed by Brian Koppelman and David Levien, this film about family &#151; in the genealogical and mob senses &#151; relies for its happy post-massacre ending on the assumption that its putative heroes have not left scores of clues to their identity. But by the time that thought might dawn on moviegoers, they should be well on their way to the exits, perhaps wishing that they had waited until &quot;Knockaround Guys&quot; turned up as a free attraction on television.

"In this flat-footed feminist fight picture, Meg Ryan, with a grating Midwestern accent, plays the real-life boxing manager Jackie Kallen as a kind of ringside Erin Brockovich, with sexy clothes and endless gumption. Starting out as an underappreciated executive assistant (whose boss runs the Cleveland Coliseum), Jackie storms the all-male world of professional boxing with a rough, hard-punching middleweight named Luther Shaw (Omar Epps). The script is pretty much one cliché after another, and Charles S. Dutton's direction, in both the dramatic scenes and the fight sequences, is workmanlike, but some interesting and complex issues of race, ambition and masculinity hover over the cheery, inspirational story like a cloud of cigar smoke. Some of the performances — notably Tony Shalhoub as Jackie's dapper, vicious nemesis and Kerry Washington as her sidekick (and Luther's love interest) — have an idiosyncratic flair sadly missing from the picture as a whole. — A. O. Scott",12509,1
"The independent filmmaker Larry Fessenden has set himself a challenging project: to approach the themes and thrills of the classic American horror movies through a determinedly modern approach, as if John Cassavetes had been working for Universal in the early 30's.

"This romantic comedy's enervated wackiness is like a trip on a ghost ship, cruising past markers of What Once Was. Alex Sheldon (Luke Wilson) has 30 days to finish a novel so he can earn the money to pay off a pair of legbreakers who look like loan officers from the projects. However, since he's experiencing a writer's block that leaves his imagination colder than this picture's, Alex hires a stenographer, the all-business Emma (Kate Hudson), in the hope of dictating a book to her during his allotted time. There's so little chemistry between Mr. Wilson and Ms. Hudson that you begin to look back on what now seems like the halcyon days of &quot;How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.&quot; Ms. Hudson has to rifle her bag of tricks — that sleepy, slightly stoned squint as if she's trying to peer through the fog and find the truth — because Emma's not a character; she's a hand-me-down comic foil, a peanut butter cookie that will eventually crumble as she's dunked into a steaming cup of love. She's there to be a steadying hand on Alex's excesses, but she's such an obvious device that when she tells him his novel is filled with unfortunate coincidences, it's the pot calling the kettle bankrupt. The picture is desperate to be a date-night event, and it feels more like a last-date movie. — Elvis Mitchell",12517,1

This fervid note sets the tone for &quot;Mad Love,&quot; an often watchable, though goofy and lurid, blast of a costume drama.

The wittiest characters are Marlin's absent-minded traveling companion, Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a cheery blue tang afflicted with short-term memory loss, and Bruce  (Barry Humphries), a scary Great White Shark who has adopted a 12-step program to curb  his insatiable appetite for other fish.

As memorably embodied by Josef Bierbichler, Brecht, who is 58 at the time of the story, comes across as a sacred monster slavishly attended by a regiment of jealous, bickering women.

"Made in 1965, around the time the term psychedelia was coined to describe a luminous Day-Glo vision of the world, Federico Fellini's phantasmagoric &quot;Juliet of the Spirits&quot; was the Italian master's first color film. Fellini went deliriously and brilliantly bananas with the color to create a rollicking through-the-looking-glass series of tableaus evoking a woman's troubled psyche. These sequences are a zany, surreal jumble of Freudian, Jungian and pagan symbolism segued into a 145-minute head trip. Although the head being explored is a woman's and the movie has been described as the female counterpart of Fellini's &quot;8 1/2,&quot; the fantasies being enacted are still Fellini's sexual obsessions but embellished with feminine frills. -- Stephen Holden",12579,1

A computer hacker (Diego Luna) takes a break from spying on his neighbor to go in on some shady business with Russian mobsters, and the ensuing wave of grisly, jokey violence sweeps up the unsuspecting proprietors of a modes beauty salon and a small pharmacy.

"Movies about survival often divide between those that grimly insist on the triumph of the human spirit and those equally grim testaments to absolute despair. In &quot;Almost Peaceful,&quot; a gently observed film about Holocaust survivors from the French director Michel Deville, survival means something other than choked laughter and sentimental bromides or brute, animal struggle. Survival also means the modest, faltering steps the not-dead take toward the resumption of everyday normal life.   Based on an autobiographical novel by Robert Bober, a French writer and filmmaker who worked as an assistant director on a handful of early Francois Truffaut features, &quot;Almost Peaceful&quot; opens in the summer of 1946. In an upstairs apartment on an anonymous Parisian street, Albert (Simon Abkarian) and his sad-eyed wife, La (Zabou Breitman), are raising  two young children and running a modest tailoring shop where most of the employees are other survivors. Amid the warm, enveloping hum of steady work and clattering machines, Jews who survived the death camps work side by side with Jews who evaded their horrors, fashioning a new world for themselves stitch by careful stitch. &#151; Manohla Dargis",12615,1

"The classical music that pours through &quot;Together&quot; infuses a  feverish emotionalism into the story of a 13-year-old violin prodigy (Tang Yun) and his   devoted father (Liu Peiqu), who would sacrifice everything for his son's future. These two  and the third major character, Lili (Chen Hong), a high-strung material girl from upstairs who becomes  a fantasy figure and surrogate mother to the boy, are broadly drawn, almost symbolic  figures in a movie that culminates with a weepy inspirational cloudburst. In the story, the  father, an impoverished cook from the provinces, takes his son to Beijing to compete in a  contest, and the boy eventually achieves his foothold but not before almost blowing his  chances. The movie is nearly stolen by Ms. Chen's hot-blooded portrait of the neighbor  whose brassy exterior covers a soft heart. — Stephen Holden",12638,1

Professionally, John has a heart  of stone, but in his private life, he is a vain, sentimental mush pot who dotes on his  girlfriend's 10-year-old daughter. Once in Buenos Aires, John, an amateur ballroom with  Valentino-ish pretensions, he discovers the tango and has a discreet flirtation with a  dancer (Luciana Pedraza). With its perfunctory dance sequences, rambling dialogue and  sketchy plot development, the movie never coheres into a drama that's credible or  gripping.

"This documentary does a thoughtful job of streamlining the bloody realities —  both literal and psychological —  of China's Cultural Revolution into roughly two hours of film. The movie begins with clips from a 1964 musical extravaganza,  as the narrator Margot Adler puts it, called &quot;The East Is Red.&quot; &quot;Red,&quot; photographed in volcanic color, splashes its rhetoric in terms so simple that the scenes almost become Brechtian — more specifically, it's a crude musical essentially produced by Mao, the Arthur Freed of Communism. The pieces of this musical shown in &quot;Morning Sun&quot; are so fulsomely straightforward that being denied a chance to see it in its entirety feels like a form of deprivation. That is, until the directors focus on the adults who were indoctrinated under the firm, unambiguous hand of Mao. Then deprivation is defined in truly horrific terms. One of the grown-ups describes the Revolution in grimly elegant fashion: &quot;It was an age ruled by both the poet and the executioner; poets scattered roses everywhere, while the executioner cast a long shadow of terror.&quot;  It was a force that, as &quot;Sun&quot; reminds us, molded a new generation into killers without any sense of the long and tortured history of a China that existed before Mao brutally eliminated all traces of it. One of the few subtle points of &quot;Sun&quot; is that even simple, lurid tragedy looks different to its admirers as people mature. The eloquence of the interview subjects  and the clips have a power that the written narration, which often sounds like an &quot;All Things Considered&quot; segment, often lacks. &quot;Chairman Mao said, 'You young people are like the Morning Sun; our hope is placed on you,' &quot; remembers Li Nanyang, who was a child of 1960's China. And, as &quot;Sun&quot; unfolds, she's shown to be one of the Cultural Revolution's victims. Her father, Li Rui, who rose through the ranks to become Mao's secretary, made the mistake of criticizing a failing policy during the Great Leap Forward, when farms were converted into small factories and the resultant shortages nearly crippled the nation. His reward was being publicly repudiated and sent away. His then 9-year-old daughter was ridiculed until she denounced him. &quot;Sun&quot; ends with a reunion of father and daughter, brought together again after 11 years. — Elvis Mitchell",12778,1

"David Lynch's epic nightmare of Hollywood, which began life as an open-ended television series (like his &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;) and evolved into a movie, may be his masterpiece. A leisurely film noir that turns into a surreal montage, it is a portrait of Hollywood filtered through the director's personal iconography, which in many ways is more early 1960's than contemporary in mood. The story traces the loss of innocence of a dewy  Hollywood hopeful (Naomi Watts) who befriends a mysterious amnesia victim (Laura  Harring) searching for her identity. Their journey figuratively plunges them through the looking glass into a phantasmagoric dream world. — Stephen Holden",12861,1

"There are diabolically smart surprises wherever you care to look in this glittering thriller. Proving that the brilliance of &quot;The English Patient&quot; was no fluke, Anthony Minghella shapes a hypnotic, sensually charged adaptation of Patricia High smith's fascinatingly reptilian murder story. The traffic-stopping cast includes Matt Damon as the dangerous chameleon of the title and, in a star-making role, the English actor Jude Law as a rich dilettante who exerts a homoerotic magnetism. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the odd woman out with the shrewdness of a fine character actress, while Cate Blanchett makes the delirious most of her role as a needy American post-debutante. As the story's odious playboy-snob, Philip Seymour Hoffman is scene-stealingly wonderful. Gorgeously photographed in Italy by John Seale. &#151; Janet Maslin",12870,1

Vince Vaughn, his &quot;Swingers&quot; co-star, does a real- life version of his bouncing boychick from that previous hit; here, he plays a would-be hipster  with echolalia. Bobby (Mr. Favreau), a failing boxer with more heart than brains, drags his loser buddy Ricky (Mr. Vaughn) along from Los Angeles to New York to do some work for a mob fixer (Peter Falk). They leave a trail of apologies and screw-ups in their wake. It's often funny, thanks to Mr. Falk, Sean (I'm Neither Puff Daddy Nor P. Diddy) Combs and  a series of cameos. But Mr. Favreau may  have taken on too much; he might have been  better off behind the camera. — Elvis Mitchell",12876,1

Bo is one busy prostitute — one police detective is begging him to testify against his abusive father, while another (Richard Bohringer, he of the voice who blows sub-woofers) is after him as the prime suspect in a series of murders of cross-dressing prostitutes.  But Bo, involved in a masochistic obsession with his handsome, thuggish neighbor, has no time for such trifles.  Directed by the veteran French melodramatist Francis Girod (&quot;Le Bon Plaisir&quot;), the picture walks a wobbly line between the glossy and the sordid. — Dave Kehr",12881,1

And a pack of pumped-up neighborhood fellas leap out of a car to confront Bobby and, despite his bring-it-on manner, beat him as if he were cake batter. His hooker girlfriend, Lucy (Susan Mitchell), walks up to him and slaps the taste out of his mouth while he's  drinking beers with his boys.

The movie succeeds, but it does have its faults - the attempt to weld social melodrama and suspense creaks at some of the joints.

"Abel Ferrara's film caused a stampede when it was shown at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival. That it is being released in 2001 says a lot about what the film promises, and what the film delivers. Matty (Matthew Modine) is a popular, pampered and prosperous movie star with the sort of substance abuse problems common to Mr. Ferrara's characters. The balance of the film is concerned with Matty's quest for forgiveness and redemption, a quest complicated by the fact that Matty has no clear idea of what he is atoning for. Like most of Mr. Ferrara's films, &quot;The Blackout&quot; takes place in a trance state — events are fuzzy, line readings even fuzzier. There are mysterious ellipses in the plotline and lots of droning electric guitar work on the soundtrack. — Dave Kehr",12951,1

The commentary &#151; provided by some of Chaplin's children, by film scholars and by artists ranging from Martin Scorsese to Johnny Depp &#151; is illuminating, and Mr. Schickel's narration (read by Sidney Pollack) provides an elegant and erudite reminder of Chaplin's importance. &#151; A.

The premise, too, has a nice frost of screwball cynicism, as the two principals woo each other for venal, professional reasons.  Ben (Mr. McConaughey), a tomcatting ad man, must make a woman fall in love with him if he is to win a big account; to write a feature story for a women's magazine, Andie (Ms. Hudson) must drive a man away. Would you believe that they actually fall in love?

Robin Williams stars as Parrish, the manager of a one-hour photo stand in the Sav-Mart superstore. His job, developing the photographs his customers drop off, allows him to peer into their lives, providing a view that  reminds him how empty his own life is. Unfortunately, Mr. Romanek has completely conceived only one role in this movie about a man who views people as perfect archetypes and becomes enraged when they fall short. &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; turns everyone but the central character into a cutout. — Elvis Mitchell",13051,1

"To lead the rock 'n' roll life  may be to drink deeply from the fountain of youth, but the rigors and temptations of that  life often point to an early death. Take the Ramones, the seminal punk rock band whose  history is traced in exhaustive detail in this absorbing documentary. The band's geeky, rubber-lipped lead singer, Joey Ramone,  aka Jeffrey Hyman, and its skinny, heavily tattooed bassist, Dee Dee Ramone, aka  Douglas Colvin, died a year apart, in 2001 and 2002, at 49 and 50 respectively. In  between those deaths, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. As the movie reveals even more starkly than the recent Metallica documentary, &quot;Some Kind of  Monster,&quot; harmony among band members gets harder to sustain as the years gather,  youthful enthusiasm wanes, and personalities define themselves. The Ramones' defiant, often funny bubblegum punk and the group's uniform image of black-leather street punks  and its adoption of a common last name, Ramone, camouflaged its members' serious  personality disorders and conflicts. &#151; Stephen Holden",13061,1

The other foot is rutted knee-deep in the muck of perpetual puerility according to  Hollywood. The movie is a sub-sub-&quot;After Hours&quot; odyssey in which the title characters, while stoned on a Friday night, catch a galloping case of the munchies from a television  ad for White Castle burgers and embark on an all-night search through the wilds of New  Jersey for the nearest outlet. Along the way the pair is menaced by a gang of extreme sports punks, a rabid raccoon and a computer-generated cougar they use as a getaway horse. Surviving one mishap after another, the pair finally arrive by hang-glider at their junk food shrine. The chemistry between the two is as old as Abbott and Costello. &#151; Stephen Holden",13063,1

Instead of Ho Chi Minh City, the setting is America in 1975 &#151; specifically, Camp Pendleton in Southern California, the Marine base that became a temporary home to thousands of Vietnamese refugees, taken in by the United States government as the south fell into the hands of the North Vietnamese Army. &quot;Green Dragon&quot; drives for the same kind of bittersweet, conciliatory tone that &quot;Three Seasons&quot; achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality. &#151; Dave Kehr",13080,1

"Like something advertised in the Sharper Image catalog, Tony Scott's movie is a sleek, expensive-looking gizmo of doubtful utility. Its kinetic editing, exotic locations and general atmosphere of high-stakes espionage can't quite cover up the shallow, cynical emptiness at its heart, but &quot;Spy Game&quot; does offer some fun on its noisy journey to nowhere. Robert Redford plays a C.I.A. maverick on the eve of retirement who uses his interrogation by agency brass as an occasion to reminisce about his star-crossed relationship with Brad Pitt, whose character he recruited as an agent and who now awaits execution in a Chinese prison. Mr. Redford's performance is wry and enigmatic, and recalls several of his movies from the 1970's, when much of this film takes place. There are shades of &quot;The Great Gatsby,&quot; &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot; and, oddly enough, &quot;The Way We Were,&quot; but with Mr. Pitt, more or less, in the Barbra Streisand role. – A.

He's sentenced to anger management training, ordered by a judge to seek treatment from Dr. Buddy Rydell (Mr. Nicholson). After a few other mishaps, the court orders Rydell to move in with Dave. Rydell's manner — full of smooth, rational explanations that bubble into hostile eruptions of id in numbing alternation — is so disruptive that he seems as much like a doctor as Dr. Bombay from the old &quot;Bewitched&quot; series. He seems to be announcing to the world that he's a charlatan, though what is eventually announced is that the halfhearted &quot;Anger Management&quot; isn't much of a movie, despite a few awe-inspiring touches of absurdity in David Dorfman's script.  — Elvis Mitchell",13112,1

Although the acting is uneven (Cameron Diaz is disappointing as a tough team owner), and the final scenes are shamelessly &quot;Rocky&quot;-ish, the movie delivers a credible, action-charged vision of the frenzied world of professional sports as a metaphor for the volatility of American culture. — Stephen Holden",13118,1

"Zhang Yang's film tells the story of Jia Hongsheng, a rising Chinese movie star of the early 1990's whose career was derailed by drug problems and mental illness. If Mr. Zhang's subject matter is, to some degree at least, quintessentially American, his approach to storytelling might be called Iranian. The role of Jia Hongsheng is played by the actor himself, and nearly all of the other characters in the film, from his parents (who are, like their son, professional actors) to his fellow inmates at a psychiatric hospital, likewise play themselves. This technique has been used, to extraordinary effect, by Iranian filmmakers like Abbas Kiarostami (most famously in &quot;Close Up&quot;) and Samira Makhmalbaf (in &quot;The Apple&quot;). It sounds exploitive, but it is really the opposite. Somehow, inviting people to recreate moments of vulnerability and confusion affirms their dignity rather than stripping it away. — A. O.

"In his feature film debut, Martin Doblmeier has assembled a documentary that's also a touching narrative on the nature of faith, and the film is far more successful when raising questions of spirituality and Christianity than when dealing with the subject at hand. That subject is the story of the German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who stood early in his opposition to Hitler and whose need to be a part of restorative change during World War II later involved him in a conspiracy to assassinate the Nazi leader. Bonhoeffer's part in this plot as a member of the most famous attempt on Hitler's life &#151; a bomb placed in a conference room that came close to achieving its aim &#151; cost him his life just  as the Nazi effort was winding down and Hitler was presumed dead. Bonhoeffer's family, a group of forward-thinkers, is described early in the documentary as &quot;conservative in the best way, open to something new but not losing touch with where they stood.&quot; The filmmaking isn't particularly stirring, but the film itself is comparable to the admirable &#151; and unusual &#151; definition of the word conservative. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",13203,1

Mia (Anne Hathaway), an awkward 15-year-old in San Francisco, discovers that she is actually a princess. It would be wish-fulfillment for most girls, except that her dream is to be invisible. Clarisse (Julie Andrews), the grandmother she has never known, turns out to be the queen of Genovia, which from the look of things in this blandly reassuring comedy, must be a small principality just outside Brentwood. - Elvis Mitchell",13225,1

Especially when he goes into a mating dance with a female goat and feeds a bird (birdy-style) in an animal shelter, this fable about the dog beneath the skin is very funny. Mr. Schneider brings an endearing innocence to a role that others would have played with a nasty leer. — Stephen Holden",13263,1

"Filmed in black and white, largely in what looks to be a loft on the Brooklyn waterfront, &quot;Afraid of Everything&quot; has a distinctly European flavor, thanks not only to its two leading performers, the French actresses Natalie Richard (&quot;Irma Vep&quot;) and Sarah Adler (who appears in Jean-Luc Godard's new film, &quot;Notre Musique&quot;).  The writer and director, David Barker, discards the didactic tone of so much American independent filmmaking in favor of a character study that leads to no easy conclusions.  A former flight attendant who lost a leg in an accident, Ms. Richard has been afraid to leaver her apartment for a year; her younger sister (Ms. Adler) is a more impulsive, liberated type who comes for a visit, with awkward consequences for Ms. Richard's dour, live-in boyfriend, Daniel Aukin.  What sounds like another sappy fable of the carpe diem stripe develops into an opaque drama charged by unstated, subterranean tensions. &#151; Dave Kehr",13265,1

When Jim Doyle (David Wenham), a hotshot young mathematician, approaches Simon with designs for a computer program based on chaos theory that Jim says can predict stock market crashes, Simon decides to invest in perfecting it. The whole idea of such a program is ridiculous, of course. But its very preposterousness doesn't make the movie any less entertaining.

"In the tawdry life and violent demise of Bob Crane, star of the television sitcom &quot;Hogan's Heroes,&quot; Paul Schrader has found a subject well suited to his preoccupations with sex, pornography and the existential agony of self-deluded men. As played by Greg Kinnear, Crane is an affable, charming fellow undone by fame, promiscuity and videotape. His sex addiction is made creepier by his compulsion to record his trysts with the aid of technology supplied by John Carpenter (Willem Dafoe), a video expert who was later tried in Crane's murder, and acquitted (a verdict the film regards with implicit skepticism). Despite Mr. Kinnear's smart, vivid performance, the movie keeps Crane at a distance. Mr. Schrader is ultimately less interested in the man than in the condition, and he has produced a moral tale that is chilling and disturbing but never really moving. — A. O. Scott",13315,1

The film, however, makes one thing abundantly clear.

"If a movie requires the lead to spend a good chunk of his time onscreen talking to himself, it's hard to do better than Johnny Depp, whose performance as the writer Mort Rainey is the highlight of this underwhelming film. A suspense thriller whose only suspense, and thrills, comes from an audience wondering if the picture will hit its promised 97-minute running time, &quot;Secret Window&quot; dramatizes Mort's plight. He's suffering from writer's block, triggered by the tumultuous break-up of his marriage to Amy (Maria Bello), and the protracted divorce proceedings. Mort lives in a remote cabin until a thunderous knock at the door rouses him from a sofa almost as lived-in as his bathrobe. The visitor is John Shooter (John Turturro), who drawls menacingly, &quot;You stole my book.&quot; Sleepy and astounded, Mort gets the evidence shoved into his life.  Shooter's short story reads exactly like Mort's best-selling murder mystery, &quot;Secret Window.&quot; What's worse, Shooter gives Mort three days to set things right, or else. What little intrigue the movie has comes from Mort's shattered self-esteem; he asks himself if he really was capable of stealing Shooter's story vowel for vowel. Unfortunately, such a concern may not mean a whole lot to most viewers. Then again, neither will the whole of &quot;Secret Window,&quot; which has the vague plotting generally found in an anthology horror-show episode. — Elvis Mitchell",13344,1

"&quot;Lan Yu&quot; was filmed in Beijing without government permission and is based on a novel published anonymously on the Internet in 1997.

American audiences (and ones in Hong Kong, where the director, Stanley Kwan, is based) may not find this movie  terribly shocking, but its sexual and political frankness have made it virtually unreleasable in China. &quot;Lan Yu&quot; not only includes some fairly explicit love scenes, it also uses the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 and the shady dealings of the country's business elite as central plot devices.

"This deadpan comedy of uncertain sexual identity holds out the promise of a spicy erotic roundelay but quickly turns into an earnest talkfest (embellished with  flashes of nudity and explicit dialogue) that feels stiffly programmatic and ultimately false. All the major characters yearn for people they essentially can't have (even when they have sex with  them), and the movie plays like a clotted, multi-sexual elaboration of &quot;No Exit.&quot; The irritating central character is a masochistic bisexual lawyer (Pascale Greggory) who in vacillating between his  long-time law partner (Nathalie  Richard), his adoring young male roommate and a convicted  (heterosexual) murderer, spreads frustration wherever he goes. — Stephen Holden",13431,1

"Filmed in Calgary by the Canadian director, Gary Burns, this smart, sardonic satire is narrated by Tom Bennett (Fabrizio Filippo), a cynical young trainee of five months at a corporation whose line of business is never made clear. Tom, like many of his co-workers, lives in an apartment complex that is accessible to his office without his actually having to go outdoors. In a mordant running joke, he has a bet with three of his colleagues to see who can last the longest without ever going outside. As clever as it is, &quot;Waydowntown&quot; is limited by its subject matter. No matter how imaginatively handled, the theme of modern corporate sterility remains a cliché. Even satirically inflated, the absurdities and petty humiliations of corporate life still loom as teeny potatoes. – Stephen Holden",13443,1

Movie stars, spies,  government ministers and jailbirds collide in a panoramic gridlock when the advancing  German army threatens Paris and the city's upper crust flees en masse to the Hotel  Splendide in Bordeaux. The film, with many subplots, blurs the line between comedy and  epic drama so adroitly that the two styles fuse into something quite original: a lyrical  farce that pays homage to its period in any number of ways. Isabelle  Adjani portrays a  spoiled, pouting movie star whose manipulation of once and future lovers, keeps  everybody hopping. — Stephen Holden",13452,1

"Michael Kalesniko's acerbic comedy is a Hollywood rarity, a movie about an icy grown-up heart-warmed by a child that doesn't wield emotional pliers to try to squeeze out tears. That frosty heart belongs to Peter McGowan (Kenneth Branagh), a whiny, cynical British-American playwright, nicknamed America's Favorite Bastard, who lives comfortably in a Los Angeles suburb with his wife, Melanie (Robin Wright Penn). The child, Amy Walsh (Suzi Hofrichter), is an 8-year-old who moves in next door with her mother, Trina (Lucinda Jenney), and their very noisy dog, Baby. &quot;How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog&quot; reminds us that when it comes to comedy, it's  all in the writing. Mr. Kalesniko's satirically barbed screenplay, whose spirit harks back to the comic heyday of Blake Edwards, stirs up an insistent verbal energy that rarely flags. – Stephen Holden",13465,1

Richard Gere gives one of his subtlest performances  as her loving control freak of a husband driven to commit a crime of passion.

"A mercilessly gritty portrait of Alix  (Ana Reeder), a junkie scrounging for herself on the Lower East Side, &quot;Acts  of Worship&quot; is drawn from the director's own experiences on the streets more than a  decade ago. The core of the movie follows the heroic attempt by Alix's neighbor Digna  (Michael Hyatt), a successful young photographer and herself a recovering addict, to rescue her. For all the misery on view, the movie doesn't belong to the shock school of  addiction films represented by &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; or &quot;Spun,&quot; which concentrated on  sensations rather than characters. Nor does it pretend to be a weepy Hollywood  redemption fantasy. It knows full well that even the happiest endings are conditional and  subject to change. &#151; Stephen Holden",13485,1

"All the talk of glory and immortality is a clear signal that this big, expensive, intermittently campy example of Hollywood Homerism is desperate to be regarded as a classic. It isn't, but it's not so bad either. Yes, the score is dreadful and the dialogue sometimes painfully obvious, but Wolfgang Petersen and David Benioff take the ancient world and its notions of war seriously. Brad Pitt, in spite of an odd pseudo-English accent (perhaps adopted in deference to the mostly British and Australian cast), plays Achilles with wit and charisma, turning the character into a kind of existentialist warrior rock star. Eric Bana, as Achilles' Trojan counterpart and nemesis, Hector, has a brooding sensitivity that contrasts with Mr. Pitt's brashness. Some of the battle scenes have a vigorous old-time grandeur, and though it takes some inevitable liberties with the source material, the film is more astute about the political and moral complexities of war than most recent combat pictures. — A.

"At the center of Miguel Arteta's funny, creepy and poignant new film is Buck, a 27-year-old man who inhabits the mental world of a preadolescent boy. As played by Mike White, who also wrote the screenplay, Buck is needy and sensitive, an object equally of sympathy and revulsion. The film chronicles his attempt to rekindle his childhood bond with his old friend Charlie (Chris Weitz), who has grown into a distant, self-absorbed careerist. Mr. Arteta's visual sense, Mr. White's insightful script and strong supporting performances from Mr. Weitz and his brother Sam, as well as from Lupe Ontiveros as a kindly theater manager, make this one of the most unusual and affecting coming-of-age stories in some time. ''Chuck and Buck'' is an antidote to the current epidemic of lazy nostalgia for the innocence of childhood and therefore, magically, one of the few truly grown-up movies you're likely to see this year. &#151; A.

Wesley Snipes plays Monroe Hutchens, doing time in prison for a crime he did commit: as a young professional boxer, he earned a life sentence for beating a man to death outside the ring. He's now throwing blows in the illegal prize fights set up by a heartless, corrupt prison guard. Monroe reigns with an iron hook; he's undefeated. When Chambers comes up against Monroe at chow after learning of his record, he blasts Monroe with a blow and a challenge. The rest of the picture is about Chambers's trying to force the fight. Walter Hill's diverting film is a ripe and vivid slice of action melodrama. Although at times the picture seems to have been edited with a blowtorch, it gets the job done efficiently and swiftly. — Elvis Mitchell",13564,1

"This film is a dizzying river of fun, high spirits and unabashed silliness so overpowering that a stream of enthusiasm overflows its banks. It would be fair to say that the movie is  better than both the television show that inspired it  as well as its film predecessor — and that's even a compliment.  Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu return as clumsy Natalie, boy-crazy Dylan and semi-prim Alex in a sequel whose sugar-rush absurdity almost defeats the forces of logic, taste and conventional narrative. It's as cheerfully, enjoyably humid as the first blast of summer light and heat. &quot;Throttle&quot; is so much like a feature-length cartoon that you may find yourself sitting through the end credits waiting to see who provided the voices for the — if you'll pardon the expression — characters. The idea that McG and the screenwriters use to inform the picture with an abiding sweetness is to treat the Angels like a family. But what carries more weight than any threat to the world — which they can overcome with one hand tucked into a thong behind their backs — is a peril to the bonds that hold the Angels together. And in &quot;Throttle,&quot; there are three looming dangers to Charlie's brood: one is the retired Angel-gone-renegade Madison Lee (Demi Moore), who's saddled with the traditional threat to national security. Another is Dylan's former lover, the Irish mob leader Seamus O'Grady (Justin Theroux). And perhaps the most insidious of all is Pete (Luke Wilson), who has just moved in with Natalie and may pop the question.

Scenery-chewing performances by Gary Oldman (as the scrofulous, misogynist congressman who leads the smear campaign), Mr. Bridges as a Clinton-Johnson presidential amalgam and Ms. Allen as the dignified and high-principled nominee contribute to the fun. — Stephen Holden",13612,1

"It is possible to detect — amid all the graphic simulated violence and graphic, apparently unsimulated sex that make up most of the movie's action — the glimmer of an idea, which is that women are every bit as capable of sociopathic mayhem and remorseless sexual hedonism as men. A logical corollary is that women — like Virginie Despentes and Coralie Trin Thi, the directors of &quot;Baise-Moi&quot; — can make exploitative, nihilistic, faux-serious movies about sex and violence just as well as their male counterparts. Ms. Depentes and Ms. Thi push chic amoralism to its logical conclusion, composing a numbing alternation of pornographic scenarios and brutal killings. The result is like something you'd see momentarily unscrambled on a hotel television set, but with better music and a little more of a story line. - A. O. Scott",13654,1

"&quot;Haiku Tunnel,&quot; billed as &quot;an office comedy,&quot; asks the question: can a feature-length movie be built on minutiae like jammed copying machines, unsent business letters and orientation programs for new employees? This innocuous wisp of a film, as weighty as a scrap of fax paper caught in an updraft, suggests that the answer is no. Directed by Jacob and Josh Kornbluth, who adapted the screenplay with John Bellucci from a performance monologue by Josh, who portrays his eponymous alter ego, it follows the misadventures of a mildly paranoid, compulsively self-deprecating office temporary at a San Francisco law firm. Almost from the beginning, it's obvious that &quot;Haiku Tunnel&quot; is a 40-minute short that imagines itself as a feature film. - Stephen Holden",13661,1

Diane is a brave, outspoken woman with a  horrendous family history. Now clean and sober and fortified by her Christian faith, she  is determined to get a job and reunite under one roof the family that was taken from her  and scattered among various foster homes. But the wounds of the past aren't so easily  healed. The painful turning point of a story that spans several years comes when Diane  feels obliged to report Love as a neglectful mother, and Donyaeh is put in a foster home. — Stephen Holden",13707,1

While Pedro Almodóvar might have played Alberto's dilemma as farce, and any half-dozen French filmmakers might have made a wistful romantic comedy, Mr. Vera steers right down the middle of the melodramatic road.

The movie is pure hokum, but at least it spins out a yarn. The core of the film, set in the early 60's, consists of pulpy visualizations of the brothers' swashbuckling adventures overseas when they were young. And oh yes, Walter adopts a very tame, very old former circus lion that becomes as loyal as a guard dog. — Stephen Holden",13738,1
"David Mamet may not be a great filmmaker, but with this moody political thriller he proves himself, once again, to be a thrillingly competent one. His tightly coiled plot and swift, economical direction shows up the bloat and incoherence that afflict most Hollywood suspense pictures these days, and the many little touches of Mametude — jagged one-liners, swaggering repartee, William H. Macy — make it unusually flavorful. Val Kilmer, his sorrowful cool nicely suited to the fiercely stylized acting Mr. Mamet requires, plays a secret agent who must rescue the kidnapped daughter of a prominent politician. The plot's twists and turns ultimately lead nowhere very interesting, but for much of its running time the picture hums along beautifully, fueled by a potent mix of technical assurance and professional braggadocio. — A.

Lovingly dedicated to actresses who have played actresses, this film weaves its own soap opera around ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' and tells of splendidly resilient women; Pedro Almodovar has aptly described his material as ''screwball drama.'' Rich and entertaining, this story celebrates the power of artifice and impersonation to transcend ordinary truth.

Like the 1927 &quot;Metropolis,&quot; a film that set the pattern for countless futuristic thrillers, &quot;Box Head Revolution&quot; imagines a rigidly segregated society in which the ruling class lives above ground while the workers labor far beneath. If in &quot;Metropolis&quot; the plutocrats were allowed to wear snazzy British suits, those of &quot;Box Head Revolution&quot; must content themselves with plastic masks, molded to resemble fairy tale figures.  Members of the lowest order must wear small, wooden boxes locked on their heads as they go about their menial tasks. &#151; Dave Kehr",13795,1

"Lukas Moodysson's lively and provocative Swedish film takes place in 1975 and almost entirely within the rambling and ramshackle suburban house that is home to an idealistic commune named Tillsammans, which means together in Swedish. The house's fragile network of relationships is shattered by the arrival of the conventional, middle-class sister of one of the house's members. She is running away from her abusive alcoholic husband, with her two young children reluctantly in tow. Just as the film's title is beginning to seem bluntly ironic, Mr. Moodysson's script takes some delightfully unexpected turns, and the characters begin to reunite in new combinations and with a new, perhaps more realistic understanding of the forces that bind them together. The film never feels less than completely natural as it moves toward the reconfigurations that provide its sunny climax. Here is one of the most pleasant foreign films of the year, a funny, graceful and immensely good-natured work. - Dave Kehr",13800,1

"Legend has it that Mississippi is home to more writers per capita than any other state in the union. Arliss Howard's &quot;Big Bad Love,&quot; based on stories by the Mississippi writer Larry Brown, takes place in a ripely literary corner of Dixie. Leon Barlow, the hero and narrator (played by Mr. Howard) sits at his Royal manual and bangs out lyrical prose and feverish poetry, and the world he inhabits springs from a sensibility not far from his own. As a director, Mr. Howard is intoxicated with the lean lyricism of Mr. Brown's writing, to which he adds poetic flourishes of his own. He prefers lush, dreamy imagery and free-associative editing to linear narration, and the movie's look and rhythm is, like Leon himself, alternately charming and annoying. – A. O. Scott",13827,1

"At least as far back as 1927 and &quot;The Jazz Singer,&quot; movies were telling the story of an immigrant's son who angers his father by breaking with tradition to pursue a career in popular music.

Written and directed by Mr. Mehta and starring Aalok Mehta, his brother, this modest film turns a good-humored, sometimes satiric eye not only on the elders and Indian ways but also on college students and their rites.  &quot;American Chai&quot; may not tell a new story, but in its understanding, often funny way, it tells a story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation. &#151; Lawrence Van Gelder",13858,1

Elmo, on the run from the Los Angeles drug dealer he double-crossed, teams up with a Liverpool lowlife (Robert Carlyle) and his ex-girlfriend (Emily Mortimer), a hired assassin. Ronny Yu's caffeinated style generates neither humor nor suspense, and the movie comes of as a dumbed-down version of &quot;Snatch&quot; or &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,&quot; if you can imagine such a thing. — A.

The tale, in any case, is so gripping, so full of improbable turns and agonizing reversals that it bears repeating.

"This documentary takes us back to a simpler time: the late 1990's, when all Americans had to worry about was their President's sexual indiscretions. Harry Thomason, is, of course, the celebrated friend of Bill Clinton who, as the producer of such Southern-fried situation comedies as &quot;Designing Women&quot; and &quot;Evening Shade,&quot; was Mr. Clinton's Hollywood connection. As such, he is hardly a dispassionate observer of what his film terms &quot;the 10-year campaign to destroy Bill Clinton&quot; on the part of conservative activists, though the film does dutifully scold Mr. Clinton for his infidelities. But mostly the film exists to document the vast, unethical lengths Mr. Clinton's enemies went to in hopes of discrediting him, with testimony from cable news regulars like Jeffrey Toobin, James Carville and Paul Begala, as well as figures, like Susan McDougal, involved in the Whitewater investigations. — Dave Kehr",13881,1

"This American remake of a famous Japanese suspense film is about an urban legend that has come to life: whenever a mysterious, unlabeled videotape is run, its unlucky viewer gets a phone call just after seeing it. The voice on the other end of the phone says simply, &quot;Seven days.&quot; It's how long the viewer has to live, and the corpse looks like something out of a Francis Bacon daydream.   When her niece dies after seeing the videotape, Rachel (Naomi Watts), a Seattle reporter,  decides to investigate the rumors.  She watches the freakout tape, complete with suffering animals and  static-ridden flash cuts.  Much of what follows consists of closeups of the clues that Rachel, desperate to stay alive, sifts through to solve the mystery. But while impressively made, this impassive and cold feature fails, in a spectacular fashion, to deliver the thrills. — Elvis Mitchell",13899,1

Dominique Blanc and Gilbert Melki, playing a schoolteacher and police detective in the French city of Grenoble, appear on the edges of the other two films, and this one places the enigmatic agony of their characters at the center. Pascal (Mr. Melki) is torn between his devotion to his job and his loyalty to his wife, who seems to be slipping away into a morphine haze. The scenes between them have an elegiac intensity not matched in either of the other films, which actually undermine the powerful narrative logic of this one. You come away realizing that, if he limited himself to making one movie at a time, Mr. Belvaux could be smashingly good director. &#151; A.O. Scott",13901,1

Tobey Maguire and Skeet Ulrich are childhood friends on the Confederate side, and the pop star Jewel (in her movie debut) is a young widow they both love. Even cooler in tone than &quot;The Ice Storm,&quot; the movie is visually stunning and historically provocative but dramatically flat. — Stephen Holden",13904,1

"Long awaited, enormously expensive, endlessly gossiped-about, Martin Scorsese's brutal epic of mid-19th-century Manhattan is a near-great film that, as time goes by, may well make up the distance. As has happened before with this director's films, the fairly conventional story — a revenger's tragedy pitting a young Irish immigrant (Leonardo DiCaprio) against his father's killer, a nativist warlord (Daniel Day-Lewis) — is less interesting than the setting. Mr. Day-Lewis gives his character, known as Bill the Butcher, an earthy Shakespearean grandeur. In his mouth, the rough vernacular of the old New York streets becomes poetry. If Mr. DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz (in the underimagined role of a spirited pickpocket) don't shed their movie-star auras, they do show themselves to be intrepid and engaging actors. But the real achievement of the movie is in the way it brings history to life — not merely by meticulously recreating its details, but by offering a troubling and timely interpretation of how the violence and iniquity of the past continues to ramify into the present. The film, flawed and indelible, is nothing less than an attempt to reimagine the germs of America's historical identity. It suggests, with vivid plausibility, that clues to the national character can be found in the violent, contradictory and often tragic story of the urban immigrant working class. — A. O.

"Brent Meeske's hardscrabble documentary follows the last Grateful Dead tour in 1995, but it doesn't follow the band. Its subject is the devotees, the Deadheads who formed shantytown bazaars in the parking lots of arenas and stadiums around the country. For those with a soft spot for the Dead, &quot;The End of the Road&quot; will seem loving and thoughtful. For the rest of us, there's probably not enough oil in Kuwait, tea in China or weed in Marin County to make this film worth our time. -- Mitchell",14015,1
"As one character in &quot;Astoria&quot; says, there is a Greek-American law: you'll do fine as long as your parents run your life for you. That is precisely the problem that Alex (Rick Stear) faces in this small, sometimes charming but uneven debut feature written and directed by Nick Efteriades. Alex has been to college, but geographically and emotionally he has seen little of the world beyond Astoria, Queens. What he would really like to do is join an archaeological expedition that is seeking the tomb of Alexander the Great. In retelling this timeworn story of conflict between young men in the New World and their stubborn Old World fathers, Mr. Efteriades may not have generated many sparks, but with his affection for Astoria and its people he has given his tale a warm glow. — Lawrence Van Gelder",14016,1
"A minor addition to the tiny genre of feminist science fiction films, &quot;Teknolust&quot; is a benign, digital-age Frankenstein story about a mousy genetic research scientist, Rosetta Stone (the stunning Tilda Swinton, struggling to look plain by donning a curly wig and oversized glasses), who uses her own DNA to create three color-coded clones.  Written and directed by Lynn Hershman Leeson, who guided Ms. Swinton to a more effective performance in the 1998 &quot;Conceiving Ada,&quot; &quot;Teknolust&quot; has a lot on its mind but little on the ball when it comes to transforming thematic notions into dramatic concepts.  The most aggressive of the clones, Ruby, becomes infatuated with an irritatingly incompetent copy shop employee (ok, we got it) played by the perpetually twitchy Jeremy Davies.  Love, it seems, will help her to become real, like some sort of hormonally charged Pinocchio.  There's some potential for entertainment here, but Ms. Leeson's emphatic direction draws much of the fun from the comedy elements.  Even Ms. Swinton, usually the most restrained and elegant of performers, can be found mugging outrageously as she strains to put over the less-than-convulsive laugh lines. &#151; Dave Kehr",14017,1

Ben Stiller is his best friend, Tim, who lives across the street and stews in jealousy of his pal's wealth. The movie gets laughs from Nick's grotesquely extravagant lifestyle. But instead  of honestly confronting the subject of wealth and Schadenfreude and the consumer  culture, not to mention the Swiftian implications of the miracle product that makes Nick  rich, it goes on silly farcical tangents that run out of steam. One involves the J-Man  (Christopher Walken), a mysterious and slightly sinister drifter who appoints himself Tim's cynical adviser. The movie, which plays like Barry Levinson's attempt to match the Farrelly Brother in adolescent goofiness, has its laughs. But it's also afraid of itself, as though it decided its chosen subject was too serious for comedy. — Stephen Holden",14072,1

In ways large and small, the film, set in the rugged countryside of southern France, lays out an unremittingly bestial view of human life. To describe the story as a dysfunctional homecoming would be to understate its view of family life, since the Pujols, the working-class clan under the movie's microscope, wouldn't know the meaning of the word dysfunctional.

"This magnificent ode to Factory Records tracks the rise and fall of that postpunk label. The film's central figure is Factory's co-founder and journalist turned postpunk impresario, Tony Wilson, played with a stinging, unctuous vitality by Steve Coogan.  Written by Frank Cottrell Boyce, the picture is an illustrated history as related by Mr. Wilson. Every time he opens his mouth, it's a roaming, hilarious monologue about Factory, by which he means himself. In some ways, it's a power-pop docu-comedy version of &quot;The Kid Stays in the Picture,&quot; the story of a man recreating the world around him in his own image. And like the mogul Robert Evans, Mr. Wilson's talent is taste. — Elvis Mitchell",14084,1
"Harrison Ford's character, a veteran Los Angeles detective with a callow young partner (Josh Hartnett) and sundry financial and professional problems, may be a walking cop-movie cliche, something both he and Ron Shelton, the director, seem happy to acknowledge. But rather than perpetrate another by-the-book exercise in copland corruption and underworld sleaze, Mr. Shelton opens the movie up, using its intricate plot as the frame for a collage of funny riffs and surprising performances. Mr. Hartnett's affable dimness disguises impeccable comic timing, and Mr. Ford does his loosest, wittiest work in years. The supporting cast is a goody bag stuffed with hip-hop strutters, mature bombshells and two bona fide music legends:  Gladys Knight and Smokey Robinson, who plays a put-upon cabdriver. The movie is shambling, anarchic, self-indulgent and a whole lot of fun. — A.O. Scott",14085,1

Though the proceedings are kept strictly confidential, the weekend is said to offer speeches, seminars, mock pagan pageantry and the highest level networking available on the planet. As a legalistic opening text takes hilarious pains to make clear, Harry Shearer's improvisational satire is in no way concerned with this group of wealthy, potentially litigious individuals. Instead, it is about the purely fictional rich and powerful men who gather each year at Zambesi Glen, a private campground in what looks a great deal like Sonoma County, Calif. – Dave Kehr",14100,1

"A rush of crazy exhilaration, directed by Nick Cassavetes from a lovestruck, stubbornly incorrect screenplay that his father, John, wrote but never lived to direct. In this boozy romance about true love and mad carousing, Sean Penn and Robin Wright Penn virtually channel the gutsy, overripe acting style of John Cassavetes's groundbreaking emotional explorations. John Travolta, still on his astonishing second-act career role, plays Ms. Penn's exasperated new husband (after the first marriage has understandably exploded) and expertly brings the story back to planet Earth.

"Tim Blake Nelson's updating of &quot;Othello&quot; is set in an all-white private American high school. The title character has been christened Odin, or O, a black basketball star and an athletic scholarship recruit. The idea of Shakespeare's mythic black man as an intimidator on the backboards makes sense. A shot-caller from the floor, O (Mekhi Phifer) is a decent guy whose status on the team provokes jealousy in the Iago figure, Hugo (Josh Hartnett), who schemes to do O in by any means necessary. That includes preying upon the stir caused by O's romantic pursuit of a white girl, Desi (Julia Stiles). In trying to make &quot;Othello&quot; more lifelike and bring it down to a younger audience &#151; in effect, to make it more democratic &#151; the adaptation has rendered the material artless.

When Charlie's corpse turns up and a pack of mysterious strangers pop around threatening Regina and asking questions about a treasure that he supposedly left behind, she's stunned. The truth about Charlie is that everybody knew more about him than she did.  Regina's first hope is Joshua (Mark Wahlberg), a helpful American. But when even Joshua turns out not to be what he seemed, she has to turn to Bartholomew (Tim Robbins) at the American Embassy for help. This knockabout, moderately successful remake of the 1963 comic thriller &quot;Charade&quot; lacks the heartless, silken cool of the original. Most of the remake's allure comes from the sensual, butter-voiced Ms. Newton; with her, Jonathan Demme has found the 21st-century corollary to Audrey Hepburn. — Elvis Mitchell",14185,1

"This soft, thin magic-realist fable concerns the fabulous (and largely self-fabricated) life of Edward Bloom, a garrulous Southerner played in his youth by Ewan McGregor and on his deathbed by Albert Finney. Edward is a devoted teller of tall tales, which charms everyone except his son, Will (Billy Crudup), who must overcome this estrangement before his father's death. There is an interesting family drama hidden behind all the whimsy and moonshine, but the movie is so steadfast in its admiration for Edward and his inventions that it never considers that Will might have a point. The movie, in consequence, lacks one, as it wanders through a series of cute, fairy-tale episodes, featuring, among other things, a glass-eyed witch, a pair of conjoined Korean chanteuses, and a town where nobody wears shoes. Tim Burton's imagination, so wild and marvelous in movies like &quot;Pee Wee's Big Adventure,&quot; &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; and &quot;Beetlejuice,&quot; seems to have been tamed. Rather than resonating with the uncanny magic of the unconscious, his images seem to be part of a strategy of denial, designed to obscure the possibility that Edward, a charismatic raconteur, might also be a narcissist and a compulsive liar. Will might forgive these lapses — that is a son's prerogative, after all. Far worse, from the audience's point of view, is that Edward is also a bit of a bore. — A. O. Scott",14200,1

In addition to raising money for the We Are Family Project, to pay for psychological counseling for relief workers and victims' families, the sessions, which took place in New York and Los Angeles on Sept. 22 and 23, were intended to show the world a forceful demonstration of American multicultural solidarity. As the film demonstrates, all that collective good will can begin to appear self-congratulatory when stretched into an 85-minute documentary, especially when the semistars start ooh-ing and ah-ing over one another's talent. &#151; Stephen Holden",14362,1

"Not even the civil war in what was once Yugoslavia will keep a good woman from her husband's side.

"Made the same year as David Gordon Greene's wonderful &quot;George Washington&quot; and suffering by the inevitable comparison, Adam Davidson's 2000 urban drama drifts into fairy tale, comparing and contrasting the idyllic childhood of the &quot;Our Gang&quot; films with the harsh realities of life for young people in Long Beach, California.  Alternately violent and sentimental, it is at heart a benign, likeable movie, blending fairy tale archetypes with hip-hop iconography. — Dave Kehr",14367,1

"William H. Macy plays Jerry Lootz, a man so thoroughly unlucky that he is the cause of bad luck in others. In hock to a slick, thuggish casino manager (Alec Baldwin), Jerry works as a cooler, foiling the winning streaks of customers whose good fortune threatens the house s take. His own luck begins to change when a cocktail waitress named Natalie (Maria  Bello) takes him to bed, and then falls in love with him in spite of herself. The setting- -Las Vegas with its sleazy, lowlife glamour- -feels a bit tired, and the story is hokey, but Wayne Kramer, making his feature debut as a director, reins in his gimmicky instincts enough to allow the skill of the actors to shine through the drab indie-noir conventions. Mr. Baldwin plays his villainous role with subdued relish, and Mr. Macy and Ms. Bello settle comfortably into their characters, giving them an appealing, lived-in glow. — A. O. Scott",14370,1

"Once again, machines are threatening to take over the world, and once again, they have developed feelings, which poses the usual conundrums of sci-fi philosophy. &quot;Suggested by&quot; Isaac Asimov's classic book of short stories, this sleek, hectic thriller engages some interesting ideas on its way to an overblown and incoherent ending. Will Smith, in weary-action movie mode, plays Del Spooner, a homicide detective in 2035 Chicago investigating the death of an old friend. Spooner is a confirmed robot-hater, and as he confronts his bigotry the movie develops a clever, if obvious, racial subtext. With the help of Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan), a concerned scientist, and a soulful machine, named Sonny, Spooner contends with an apparent corporate conspiracy aimed at usurping human control of everything. &quot;You're the dumbest smart person I've ever met,&quot; Spooner says to Dr. Calvin at one point, and for a dumb movie, &quot;I, Robot&quot; turns out to be pretty smart. — A.

That's a hefty agenda, even given the film's nearly six-hour running time, but in this risk-averse era, it can be a pleasure to see a film that fails by trying to do too much.

At the beginning, it looks as if &quot;American Desi&quot; might seriously tackle some of the problems of cultural identity that Krishna's situation brings up. But once he arrives at college, the movie settles for being a light romantic comedy in which he struggles to win the heart of Nina Shah (Purva Bedi), an Indian-American beauty who values traditional culture. &#151; Stephen Holden",14508,1

But its real location is that imaginary playground of cheery roughhouse and sanitized mischief known as Sitcomland, where it is now and forever 1955.  For Steve Martin, who has earned his crown as the movies' most affably, reassuring 50's-style dad since Spencer  Tracy, the role of the paterfamilias who coaches college football is just not a piece of  cake but a morsel of buttery fudge that instantly melts on his tongue. — Stephen Holden",14537,1

"If you like narrative coherence, plausible emotion and accomplished acting, &quot;Femme Fatale,&quot; the breathtakingly convoluted new thriller from Brian De Palma, may not be for you. It is, however, a reminder that there is sometimes more to movies than character and story, that formal dexterity and visual inventiveness and some nice-looking people can be the vehicles of exhilaration and surprise. These effects, above all, are what Mr. De Palma is after, and the first half of &quot;Femme Fatale&quot; provides them in abundance. The story, to the extent that it is comprehensible, is pretentious and banal. But Mr. De Palma proves that, in the absence of insight or ideas, some amazing things are possible. It is possible, for instance, to be entranced by a movie without believing it for a second. — A. O. Scott",14539,1

"This Brazilian documentary is so wrenching and absorbing that you can easily lose sight of the sophistication of its techniques. Using a combination of video taken for Brazilian television and ex post facto talking-head interviews, the filmmakers have made a deceptively straightforward film that has the force of tragedy and the depth of first-rate investigative journalism. Their work explores a bus hijacking that took place in Rio de Janeiro in 2000, and paints a heartbreaking, shocking portrait of the perpetrator, a child of the slums who had survived a notorious police massacre of homeless children in 1992, and a society riven by poverty and violence. — A.

"Set in New York City and partly filmed here, &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; (&quot;Tomorrow May Never Come&quot;) is a vigorous Bollywood blend of romantic comedy and family melodrama.  The central figure, and narrator, is Naina (Preity Zinta), a young woman who lives in a snug Indian neighborhood of tree-lined streets and detached bungalows (which looks suspiciously more like Toronto than any known borough of New York).  Naina, who wears glasses that maker her look like Ashleigh Banfield and who is studying for a business degree at the University of New York, might strike casual observers as an ideal daughter, but she is a disappointment to her large Punjabi family for the standard reason:  she is not married, and has no immediate intention to be.  Enter Aman (Shah Rukh Khan), a dashing charmer who entrances Naina  but who also has a fatal heart disease.  Like many Bollywood films, &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; has little notion of restraint.  Its luxuriant, nearly three-hour running time allows lots of room for spectacular musical numbers (including Its the Time to Disco and the plangent title song) and dramatic climaxes extended to the breaking point and beyond.  Madame Bovary had nothing on Aman, whose death scene seems to occupy several miles of celluloid.

"It's painfully understandable why the 17-year-old title character of this gripping Colombian film would risk her freedom and even her life to be a drug mule. The movie follows the desperate plunge of Maria (Catalina Sandino  Moreno) from a dead-end job as an assembly-line worker in a Colombian flower factory  into the drug-smuggling underworld. Her dangerous undertaking is her last resort when she finds herself unemployed and pregnant. Before the story zeroes in on the harrowing details of drug running and its dangers, it details Maria's hopelessly circumscribed life in a rural village. If her story is a template for countless others like it, what keeps your heart in your throat is Maria herself. In a performance that feels more lived in than acted, Ms.  Moreno's Maria is an attractive, smart, spirited young woman who faces the challenge of  fending for herself with a fierce determination and ingenuity that compromises but never  undermines her essential decency and morality. The movie sustains a documentary authenticity that is as astonishing as it is off-handed. Even while keeping you on the edge of your seat, it never sacrifices a calm, clear-sighted humanity for the sake of melodrama or cheap moralizing. &#151; Stephen Holden",14583,1

Each projector displayed a different stream of images, creating a constantly shifting mosaic of shapes, colors and human figures. Unseen for 20 years, &quot;Mahagonny&quot; (which Smith sometimes called his &quot;Film No. 18&quot;) has been restored with financing from a number of organizations. The four 16-millimeter tracks of the original have been printed onto a single 35-millimeter strip, solving the thorny problems of synchronization posed by the original. There are four large categories of imagery, which Smith identified as portraits, animation, symbols and nature. What might sound like a very precise and well-considered recipe for utter boredom becomes a marvelously seductive and sensual experience. &#151; Dave Kehr",14629,1

"When a writer-director — Cameron Crowe or Paul Thomas Anderson, for example — is in love with his characters, the fun comes when the filmmaker lets them gab away, inadvertently revealing themselves. The joy when Quentin Tarantino's creations speak is the opposite. Despite their hilariously florid rapping, his folks are also incredibly cagey: they never give the entire game away. This shrewdness is the template for the long dialogues in &quot;Kill Bill, Vol. 2,&quot; the most voluptuous comic-book movie ever made.   In this deliciously perverse picture, everything is operatic, including the despair and the pauses. Uma Thurman, whose speaking voice has a lyric, teasing quality, is just the performer to get the mordant slyness across. Mr. Tarantino's movies are also about loss and betrayal, and &quot;Vol. 2&quot; is a double-burger helping of those motifs. It is rich, substantial and sustained, yet also greasy kids' stuff, a wrapper filled with an extra large order of chili fries, stained with ketchup, salt and cheese. &quot;Vol. 1&quot; was all set-up: the longest first act in movie history, staged and edited like a series of Pablo Ferro trailers. &quot;Vol. 2&quot; is the second and third acts in one convenient serving, told in a languorous flashback-within-a-flashback style with airy long takes. Unlike the 100-meter high-hurdles of &quot;Vol. 1,&quot; this sequel is a marathon, with hills and long stretches of flatland. As in the first film, the Bride (Ms. Thurman) is on a mission of vengeance after being shot and left for dead; she's out to murder her former colleagues led by Bill (David Carradine). She calls her journey a roaring rampage of revenge. The movie, which quivers with a geek-adrenaline rush, in some ways feels like its time may have passed; this feels likes a movie Mr. Tarantino might have made before &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot; — Elvis Mitchell",14655,1

"Bernardo Bertolucci began his career with the observation that he who has not lived before the revolution has never tasted the sweetness of life. His newest film, an ardently romantic love song to sex, cinema and the spirit of the 60's, elaborates on this observation by finding sweetness in the midst of political tumult. The disturbances of 1968 in Paris take place mostly off screen, bursting in only at the end to wake up the three title characters. The trio —  an American exchange student (Michael Pitt) and a pair of lovely, moody half-French twins (Eva Green and Louis Garrel) — spend most of the picture holed up in a luxuriously squalid Paris apartment, having sex and arguing about movies, politics and the relative merits of Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix. Instead of mocking or patronizing their passion (as some critics are sure to do), Mr. Bertolucci treats these silly, earnest, beautiful young people tenderly and with generosity. As a testament to their love of movies, he inserts archival film clips culled from the repertory of the Cinémathèque Française, where the three met and where the events of May began. To feed the audiences love, he photographs his fearless young actors and their surroundings with breathtaking grace. Even if the sight of naked bodies leaves you cold, some of the director's camera movements can make you gasp with delight. — A. O. Scott",14677,1

The movie attacks the racist program of legalized  kidnapping practiced by the Australian government between 1905 and 1971, in which  children of mixed race were forcibly taken from their homes and prepared for integration into the general population. A story that could have been milked for horror and suspense focuses instead on the girls' amazing resilience as they undertake the 1,200-mile trek home on foot. Everlyn Sampi is radiant as 14-year-old Molly, the oldest of the three, and Kenneth  Branagh cannily underplays the fiendishness of the program's self-righteous executor. — Stephen Holden",14722,1
"Set in the high plains of northwestern Argentina during the dog days of summer, Lucrecia Martel's remarkable debut film portrays an ominous semi-tropical environment of grayish mountain peaks shrouded by ragged clouds. But the movie is more than a meditation on the debilitating effects of high humidity. The steamy ambience in which the characters fester is a metaphor for creeping social decay. Instead of high drama, &quot;La Ciénaga&quot; presents a relentless accumulation of small, grinding incidents that portray Argentina's provincial middle class adrift in a self-pitying limbo. We learn about the characters by eavesdropping on their telephone conversations and their desultory bickerings. As &quot;La Ciénaga&quot; perspires from the screen, it creates a vision of social malaise that feels paradoxically familiar and new. &#151; Stephen Holden",14723,1

"Lauren Ambrose, the dark-eyed young redhead who plays Claire Fisher on the HBO series &quot;Six Feet Under,&quot; gives a quietly effective, disarmingly naturalistic performance in Robert J. Siegel's &quot;Swimming,&quot; an independent feature made before Ms. Ambrose's television success. The  screenplay, of which Mr. Siegel is a co-author,  breaks little new ground in the teenage coming-of-age genre: innocence is still hard to leave behind, sex is still something both wonderful and frightening, and adults persist in revealing the feet of clay that support their seemingly heroic bearing.

Here the actor plays a Nevada  policeman on the eve of retirement who pledges to the parents of a young girl found raped  and murdered that he will find her killer. His quest becomes an obsession. Penn and Nicholson (in a brilliant, understated performance) plumb the soul of this lonely,  brooding protagonist whose mood is echoed by the ominously beautiful Western  landscape. -- Stephen Holden",14772,1

Sam Neill  is the courtly, widowed operator of the dish. The cloying rah-rah self-congratulation that  usually is affixed to this event is kept to a minimum. &#151; Stephen Holden",14774,1

The film offers a stunning re-creation of the bouts that Ali fought.

"&quot;From off the streets of Cleveland comes 'American Splendor,' &quot; screams the cover of every issue of the writer Harvey Pekar's surly and open-eyed autobiographical comic series. The towering, action-packed logo is a further sardonic comment on the lack of activity in the protagonist's life. There's as much at stake in this hilarious, moody and cantankerous film adaptation of &quot;Splendor&quot; as there was in this summer's other movies of comics anti-heroes like &quot;The Hulk&quot; and &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.&quot; Harvey is extraordinary — by the way, so is this movie. As played by Paul Giamatti, Harvey's a gray wad of anger that spends his time in his cave-like apartment, with shelves sagging under the weight of his collection of record albums and jazz 78's. And sputtering to his equally powerless pals about a world that he refuses to understand. Slumped into a posture that's a question mark with a pot-belly, Mr. Giamatti's a frustrated tremor, shaking and gesticulating futilely. The filmmakers use the real Mr. Pekar as a narrator initially. For a time, the film cuts to the real-life Pekar, fulminating onscreen with his friends against a stark-white background. This sounds like a mocking, distancing device — and in the wrong hands, it would be. But the real-life Pekar is as vivid in his way as Mr. Giamatti. The actual Pekaris a flinty crank spouting while the actors portraying figures from the streets of Cleveland chuckle in disbelief at him and his obsessive, nerdy friends, like Toby (played in the film with breath-taking precision by Judah Friedlander). The great cast also includes Earl Billings as Mr. Boats, one of Harvey bellicose, small-minded and larger-than-life co-workers, and Danny Hoch. Harvey's romantic match, Joyce Brabner, is played with a tart, intriguing directness by Hope Davis that's equal parts Emma Goldman and Olive Oyl —  that is, the Olive Oyl of the comics, not the screaming helpless No. 2 pencil of the cartoons. And the picture becomes something richer and fuller when Joyce enters the film. Harvey has someone to square off with, and her eccentricities complement his. — Elvis Mitchell",14790,1

"Most of the people remotely interested in Johnnie To's surging rehash of action clichés are probably either aficionados or  directors who have stolen much of Mr. To's gravity-defying verve for their own action movies by now. But even Mr. To, who directed along with Wai Ka Fai, can barely give the fast-paced silliness of &quot;Killer&quot; the commitment it needs. The movie follows a slaughterhouse competition between a pair of assassins-for-hire, the brooding loner O (Takashi Sorimachi) and  the leather-pants-wearing young gunslinger Tok (Andy Lau, relishing the chance to play a bad dude, for once); Tok has taken for his brother, C7 (Teddy Lin), whose seizures have rendered him unreliable. This picture is murder by numbers, and as easy to be bored by as your ABC's, despite a few whopping shootouts. But if you miss this picture, don't worry — those scenes are bound to be turned into some big-budget American-made action picture and be repeated to death in its trailer. — Elvis Mitchell",14838,1
"The latest entry in the blossoming feminexploitation genre, featuring a squad of tough, resilient, athletic young women who also happen to look great in skimpy bathing suits. Kate Bosworth plays Anne Marie, a surfer in training for the competition that will give her a shot at the big time. Among the obstacles in her way are her headlong romance with a vacationing football player and her own timidity. On the way to its unsurprising finish, the movie offers a generous and genuinely thrilling series of surfing sequences, directed and edited with enough vividness and precision to allow even the most landbound viewer to feel the exhilaration and danger of the sport. — A.

Harsh as it is, &quot;LaLee's Kin&quot; is also a testament to the resiliency of people who struggle with the grim aftereffects of generations of slavery and sharecropping, and try to provide their children with love, education and hope. &#151; A.

"Alfonso Cuarón, taking the franchise over from Christopher Columbus, injects this third Potter picture with a shadowy, sensual mood. The look is grainier and grimier, and the themes are a bit darker and more unsettling than in &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot; or &quot;Chamber of Secrets.&quot;  There is less Quidditch and more Snape, which is all to the good, as are the efforts of new cast members like Michael Gambon (taking over for Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore), Emma Thompson (as a batty divination teacher), David Thewlis (as the latest defense-against-the-dark-arts master) and Gary Oldman, who brings his adaptable villainy to the title role. The film's major weakness, sad to say, is Harry himself. Approaching adolescence, Daniel Radcliffe may also be reaching the limit of his range as an actor; he seems unable to summon the complex, volatile emotions that the story, with its notes of grief and rage amid the usual boarding-school intrigue, demands. Still, Mr. Cuarón breathes some new life — and a new sense of mystery — into a series whose charms are in danger of declining due to over-familiarity. — A. O. Scott",14844,1

The story — of a young boy (Shia LaBeouf) unjustly sent to a camp for delinquents — is intricate to the point of being hectic, but it is also surprising, moving and endlessly inventive as it bounces from present to past, from allegory to naturalism, from comedy to suspense. Along the way, its clear-eyed exploration of themes that range from the challenges of friendship to the legacy of American racism put most movies aimed at alleged grownups to shame. And grownups, even those who can't find a 10-year-old to take them along, should not be ashamed to seek out the best film released by a big American studio so far this year. — A. O. Scott",14913,1

Jean-Pierre Bacri is a 50-something sound engineer warily fending for himself after the breakup of a marriage, and Emilie Dequennne the 20-year-old housekeeper Laura, who invades his life and  lures him into an affair that takes them to the coast of Brittany for a strained vacation.

"With a running time of 6  hours and 42 minutes, this movie is the magnum opus of the independent filmmaker Ken Jacobs.  Begun in 1957 as a backyard bohemian romp starring the avant-garde legend Jack Smith &#151; an amazing proto-drag performer who later directed his own underground classic, &quot;Flaming Creatures&quot; &#151; the project grew over the years to include huge chunks of appropriated material, including, for example, the entirety of Richard Nixon's 1952 Checkers speech and what seems like most of an early 1930's documentary on what was then known as &quot;darkest Africa.&quot;  For this provisionally definitive version, Mr. Jacobs has brought his film up to date with topical references to the war in Iraq and the Bush administration.  Whether or not this is the final cut of &quot;Star Spangled to Death&quot; (Mr. Jacobs is a youthful 70, with plenty of time for further modifications), it stands as a rare living, breathing example of American avant-garde filmmaking, a species unfortunately well on its way to extinction. &#151; Dave Kehr",14946,1

"For those who thought  Seijun Suzuki's high-strung, lawless and watchably frenzied shoot-out drama &quot;Branded to Kill'' (1966) was hard to follow, his all-girl remake, &quot;Pistol Opera,'' which makes marginally more sense, will come as a relief. Imagine if Howard Hawks had remade &quot;Rio Bravo'' - well, he did actually, but suppose he had done it with a female cast and stirred in a slowed sexual tension among the characters. That's what happens here. &quot;Pistol Opera'' is insanely likable but suffers from anemia; Mr. Suzuki obviously can't crank up the high-bore hysteria he used to generate, and using movement and placement to express character as much as dialogue in an enervated environment costs this film needed urgency. Stray Cat (Makiko Esumi) is given the order to eliminate the two top-ranked killers of the Guild. This will move the third-ranked Stray Cat up to the pole position, among other things; for those in need of logic, go see &quot;Hard Boiled'' or any of the hundreds of Hong Kong action pictures that took their lead from Suzuki's baroque and enthusiastic gunplay classic — Elvis Mitchell.",14959,1

"An outback western, in which Heath Ledger, his prettiness hidden behind a heavy beard and a stiff, balky manner, plays the legendary 19th-century Australian bandit Ned Kelly. The film's idea of Kelly as an unwitting social revolutionary — somewhere between Pretty Boy Floyd and Spartacus — is interesting, but the story, in spite of its brutality, never really gathers force. The picture's rhythms are too choppy to achieve the grandeur of epic, and the performances (with the exception of Orlando Bloom as Kelly's sidekick) are lifeless and unmemorable. Naomi Watts adds a touch of golden movie-star glamour in the underwritten role of Kelly's aristocratic love interest, a part she may well have taken out of a sense of patriotic duty. — A. O.

"The Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo's 1957 film is a political movie that, partly through the powerful lead performance of its star, the relatively young Yves Montand, transcends its own politics. In its portrait of a humble fishing village, the movie reverently looks back to the early films of Rossellini. But at the same time, the movie has a high scenic gloss aesthetically at odds with neo-realist austerity. As stirringly heartfelt as it is, Mr. Montand's portrayal of a proud renegade fisherman who breaks the law to make a better life for his family is a star performance radiant with macho glamour. — Stephen Holden",14972,1

The movie was filmed while Ms. Boyd was chairman of the music department of the University of Sydney during a time of sharp financial cutbacks that threatened her department's integrity, if not its existence. As observers of an institution, the filmmakers lack the patience and thoroughness of a Frederick Wiseman. As effectively as &quot;Facing the Music&quot; conveys a sense of crisis, its detailing of the institutional nuts and bolts and the social, political and economic processes eroding the music department is sketchy and ultimately one-sided. &#151; Stephen Holden",14979,1

There is a divorce, an engagement, a sudden death, an unplanned pregnancy, a car accident, a first kiss, a bad party, and an unfair grounding, all of which add up to a Douglas Sirk after-school special. The movie an awkwardly directed, unevenly acted and sloppily written. But adolescence is a sloppy, ungainly, awkward time, and after a while, the bad lighting, graceless editing, sluggish dialogue and self-conscious performances begin to seem like marks of authenticity, as if the movie had been made not just for and about teenagers, but by them.

You would almost be tempted to smile at times, albeit weakly, if it weren't for Mr. Miike's habit of pounding home every joke with exaggerated reaction shots. His actors are continually bulging their eyes, dropping their jaws or raising their arms in mock horror, which contributes little but a sense of strain and desperation to this already attenuated film. — Dave Kehr",14988,1

Tensions build when Jane's son (Christian Bale) by a former liaison and his fiancée (Kate Beckinsale), both doctors, pay her a prolonged visit while she is completing an album with a British rock band. Although the music is more 70's and 80's than contemporary in flavor, this sexy movie, which portrays the Laurel Canyon neighborhood as a voluptuous lotus land, is a balanced, snappily written study of the reverse generation gap.

There are plenty of big low-comic laughs, culminating in an inspired slapstick chase sequence. Bridget Fonda, as a kindly sleep doctor, doesn't have a lot to do but is nonetheless a warm and radiant presence. The movie also explores some deep, rich and troubling themes. It makes a comic fantasia out of bad dreams and sexual insecurity and understands as few films do that terror and humor spring from the same unconscious sources. — A. O. Scott",15039,1

"In the role of a pugnacious United States Army Officer assigned at the end of World  War II to gather proof that the German conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler collaborated with  the Nazis, Harvey  Keitel creates the most boorish Nazi hunter ever portrayed on the screen.  It's a typically nervy performance that pumps adrenaline into what is essentially a talky  moral debate. Defending his decision not to leave Germany, the courtly conductor  vigorously insists that art is a higher calling and should be divorced from politics.  Although the screenplay, adapted by Ronald Harwood from his own play, is schematic  and talky and the issues it debates familiar, its arguments are still worth contemplating.  And in their wildly different ways, Mr. Keitel's interrogator and Stellan Skarsgard's  conductor make compelling, evenly matched adversaries. — Stephen Holden",15054,1

Both members of the Ibdaa Cultural Center, the young women exchange letters and photographs, but are prevented from meeting by border regulations. As directed by Mai Masri, &quot;Frontiers of Dreams and Fears&quot; is very heavy on heart-rending close-ups of suffering children. It is impossible not to be moved by imagery such as this, and also impossible not to feel somewhat used by it. &quot;Why are we studying?&quot; one child proclaims in voice-over, an attitude that the filmmaker appears to endorse. &quot;We have no future.&quot; But surely, in the complex context of the Middle East, this sort of sentimental passivity is an indulgence no one can afford. &#151; Dave Kehr",15060,1

Kenny (Glenn  Mulhern) is a handsome Belfast boy who comes to London to visit his boyhood chum Byron (Brendan Mackey), and soon joins him in turning tricks in gay pubs.  But when rumors arrive of a fortune stashed in the mattress of a gay Orthodox Jew (one of the many stereotypes that Mr. Lab trots out, presumably with ironic intent), the friends set out to steal it, as an on-screen counter keeps track of the comic deaths. &#151; Dave Kehr",15074,1

"A blend of &quot;Dr. Dolittle&quot; and &quot;Family Ties,&quot; the animated series &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot; has been a staple of the Nickleodeon children's cable network since 1998. Never shy about exploiting its brand names, Nickelodeon has now turned the program into a feature film, carrying over most of the creative personnel of the series. On screen, &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot; looks just as it does on television, only wider. The directors, Jeff McGrath and Cathy Malkasian, use a Cinemascope-like frame to create a cartoon Africa with a greater sweep than its television counterpart, though the visuals inevitably fall short of their obvious model, Disney's &quot;Lion King.&quot; Without the financial or creative resources of the Disney animators, &quot;The Wild Thornberrys Movie&quot; remains essentially an extended Saturday morning cartoon. — Dave Kehr",15111,1

"The imagery in &quot;A Thousand Months&quot; has a plaintive found-art beauty that Faouzi Bensaïdi, the director, uses as an elegant contradiction to the deftly woven story lines. This impressively structured melodrama, with daffy, character-revealing comic scenes, takes place in 1981 in a small Moroccan village during Ramadan. Mr. Bensaïdi follows a family — Amina (Nezha Rahil) and her young son, Mehdi (Fouad Labied) — as they arrive and move in with her father-in-law, Ahmed (Mohammed Majd). Mr. Bensaïdi builds up novelistic detail, catching the small changes and the impinging of the Western world on this village at a crucial time for it. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",15138,1

But for those in search of action-filled escapist entertainment who are willing to jettison expectations of credibility into the nearest popcorn tub, &quot;Exit Wounds,&quot; directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak (&quot;Romeo Must Die&quot;) with a sense of pace and style, will do to pass time on an inclement day. — Lawrence Van Gelder",15139,1
"In spite of a scattering of funny lines, a game performance by Catherine Zeta-Jones and amusing walk-ons by Alan Arkin and Christopher Walken, this crowded, glossy comedy lacks both the bite of real satire and the giddy effervescence of screwball. John Cusack and Ms. Zeta-Jones are a pair of narcissistic movie stars whose real-life breakup threatens the profitability of their new movie. Billy Crystal plays the over-the-hill publicist who organizes a press junket at which all manner of not terribly surprising complications ensue. Julia Roberts plays Ms. Zeta-Jones's ugly-duckling sister, who is also her long-suffering assistant and her rival for Mr. Cusack's affections. - A. O. Scott",15140,1

"Denzel Washington plays John Quincy Archibald, a man who's struggling to keep his family together.

The movie becomes &quot;Dog Day Waiting Room&quot; when John takes a group of people hostage at the hospital that's threatening to throw out his son. This country's sad state of health care for the poor and disenfranchised is a great movie subject. Until that film comes along, we'll have to endure &quot;John Q.,&quot; which will leave most audiences in dire need of medical attention, though it would be hard to say if that need will come from the painful collection of plot cliches or Aaron Zigman's assaultive soundtrack. – Elvis Mitchell",15142,1

This self-described post-punk, neo-romantic queer comedy was written and directed by Everett Lewis, known in the indie world for much heavier meals like &quot;An Ambush of Ghosts&quot; (1993).  Here, it as if the filmmaker, along with most of his characters, had taken too many self-esteem seminars at the local Learning Exchange.

Though the movie feels aimless, John Curran lets the explicit detail spell out the compulsiveness of the characters and uses jolts of humor to keep the squalor from lapsing into unrelieved unpleasantness. Ms. Horler's tender and fearless performance is just one of the elements that will stick with you. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",15158,1

"This brightly colored romp is both a loving tribute to the old Rock Hudson-Doris Day Technicolor comedies of the late 1950's and early 60's and a revisionist critique of their moldy sexual politics. Renee Zellweger and Ewan McGregor are thinner and wirier than their predecessors, but their timing and energy are impressive, as is Peyton Reed's fanatical regard for the look, sound and tone of the old pictures. This one unfolds in a fairy-tale 1962 Manhattan, its streets thronged with boxy cabs and impossibly stylish dressers. What is missing, though, is the subtext of sexual and social panic that made the earlier movies so bracing in their silliness. Ms. Zellweger's proto-feminist firebrand, an apostle of sex without love and workplace equality, tangles with Mr. McGregor's playboy journalist, with matrimony the foreordained result. David Hyde-Pierce and Sarah Paulson are the neurotic second couple, and the romantic high jinks are fairly well managed. But the laughter ultimately grows out of complacency rather than confusion, and the teasing naughtiness, at this late date, seems more dutiful than daring. — A. O. Scott",15223,1

Though Mr. Snow credits a cast, he really uses his actors like action figures and deploys postproduction technology to stretch their forms and switch them around like pieces on a game board. In effect, Mr. Snow has created an art-world companion piece to Mike Judge's wonderful anticorporate comedy, &quot;Office Space.&quot; The wanton slipperiness of &quot;*Corpus&quot; and its amiable jerking and reshaping of physical time and space would make it a great piece to watch with kids and use to introduce video as art. — Elvis Mitchell",15270,1

Directed by Ralph Torjan, once a member of Castaneda's inner circle of students, this digital video documentary piles up plenty of evidence that Don Juan, the Yaqui shaman who supposedly trained Castaneda in the ancient Indian ways of accessing alternative realties, was a complete invention on Castaneda's part.

"&quot;Mostly Martha&quot; is the latest addition &#151; and a quite adorable one &#151; to the cooking melo-comedy subgenre, where &quot;Big Night&quot; and &quot;Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?&quot; reside. It's a German comedy about a workaholic chef who has to force herself out of her fixation and get a life. The movie succeeds because the writer-director, Sandra Nettelbeck, seems as obsessive as her titular heroine.  Martha (Martina Gedeck), a chef in an upscale Hamburg restaurant, is focused and good at her game. When her 8-year-old niece, Lina (Maxime Foerste), arrives at Martha's doorstep because her mother has been killed in a car accident, Martha doesn't know what to do. The film's humor emerges from the battle of wills between Martha and Lina. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",15306,1

"A rare look at mental illness from the point of view of the afflicted, this diary-like documentary records several years in the life of John Cadigan, a young man who, he says, experienced his first psychotic break with reality as a 21-year-old art student in Pittsburgh.  The film is made up of video clips, some shot by Mr. Cadigan and others shot by his older sister Katie, who emerges as his strongest pillar of support during his prolonged illness.  As Mr. Cadigan, in a voice-over narration, describes the ups and downs of his disease — he moves from depression and paranoia to full-blown psychotic episodes, eventually somewhat softened by new medications that come on the market — he illustrates his points with scenes from his own life of quiet desperation. Very well edited by Laura C. Murray and set to an effective score by the percussionist Evelyn Glennie, &quot;People Say I'm Crazy&quot; is a small film but an extremely affecting one. — Dave Kehr",15329,1

"This superbly balanced and organized documentary about the politics of electricity in the  former Soviet Republic of Georgia portrays a country teetering on the brink of chaos. Its vision is seen largely through the eyes of Piers Lewis, a good-humored British-born  project director for AES-Telasi, the Arlington, Va.-based company that was created in  late 1990's when AES acquired the Georgian power authority, Telasi. At the time, AES  officials had no idea what they were up against. And the story of the company's struggle  to become efficient and profitable in a country where 90 percent of the citizens refused to pay  electricity bills that amounted to half their monthly income plays like an absurdist  political farce. Among the many factors held accountable are globalization, the  corruption of the country's (now-ex) president, Edward Shevardnadze, and the character  of the Georgians themselves. &#151; Stephen Holden",15342,1

"Nuri Bilge Ceylan's wry, modest meditation on pettiness works on a minimalist scale. This Turkish comedy-melodrama received the grand jury prize at 2002's Cannes International Film Festival. The film, set in Istanbul, is a study in which not much happens; Mahmut (Muzaffer Ozdemir), a photographer, allows his cousin Yusuf (Mehmet Emin Toprak), to move into his tiny apartment with him. Yusuf, a reminder of the life Mahmut has left behind &#151; they're both from the same village &#151; has plans to find a job on a ship, something that never quite happens. &quot;Distant&quot; is almost like a droll take on &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;; can two men live together without driving each other crazy? The take-and-take &#151;  rather than give-and-take &#151;  of their existence seems to be set on the head of a pin, since &quot;Distant&quot; is so minutely observed. There are a few chuckles initially, especially watching Mahmut's awful, crass attempts to pick up women, and his obsession with pornographic movies. It's soon revealed that domestic events have led to his flight into crassness, and his loss will deepen over the span of &quot;Distant.&quot; Perhaps deepen isn't exactly the word, since Mahmut and Yusuf spend an enormous amount of time watching television, perching on chairs like vultures while a procession of dreary shows moves slowly past them. &quot;Distant&quot; sometimes feels like being trapped in a hotel room on a weekday afternoon. The caginess of the performers, and the personality added by the evocative cinematography, both go a long way in adding weight to &quot;Distant.&quot;   But the self-imposed dreariness prevails: eventually, the problem is the material itself. Such an accurate depiction of cramped spirits, small-mindedness and men unable to make changes in their lives takes its toll. &quot;Distant&quot; feels as if it's going nowhere in no particular hurry, and finally leaves us distant from its characters. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",15373,1

"&quot;Bully&quot; is based on the true story of a murder in South Florida, and it purports to be a raw and honest examination of the violent, hedonistic, amoral lives of America's youth, or at least a particularly decadent and photogenic cross-section of it. The film's director, Larry Clark, has visited this territory before, in the disquieting &quot;Kids,&quot; which looks like mid-period Woody Allen compared to &quot;Bully.&quot; The story is horrifying and, if it had been competently and sensitively told, might have made a powerful and important film. But Mr. Clark seems to have approached it without a thought in his head, as though declaring his solidarity with the empty minds of the characters. Some of his detractors have called Mr. Clark a pornographer, but this is an insult to honest smut-peddlers, who treat their subjects with more respect than he does. - A. O. Scott",15393,1

"This story of the Marquis de Sade isn't exactly a docudrama. It invents elements to make its rather obvious point about the price exacted by art and the state that liberals trying to do what's right can be whipped into. Fortunately, the elegance of Philip Kaufman's direction and his handling of the cast make for the kind of euphoric stylishness that has been missing from moviegoing for some time. Much of that élan comes from Geoffrey Rush, who plays Sade as a gleeful voluptuary unfettered by either morality or what for him would be the most venal of sins, sentimentality. Sade has been confined to the Charenton Asylum, and, for him, this is merely slumming, a time when he gets to evaluate the damaged and discarded psyches that litter the rooms and decide which is his most apt target. And Mr. Kaufman revels in the chaos. — Elvis Mitchell",15395,1

"&quot;Everything that has a beginning has an end.&quot; Yes, thank God — or Neo, or the One, or the Source, or the Oracle, or the Architect, or whoever it was who set this metaphysical action trilogy in motion. &quot;Reloaded,&quot; the second installment, was overstuffed and ungainly; this concluding chapter feels padded, with a long, grinding battle sequence in the middle and a whole lot of mumbo-jumbo at the end. Keanu Reeves, perhaps worried that he was showing too much range, has purged himself of all expression apart from a worried frown and a sorrowful grimace, which is mirrored in the face of Carrie-Anne Moss, who returns as Trinity. The salient distinction of the human remnants in Zion, apart from their earth-toned natural-fiber fashions, has been the capacity for love, a word much spoken in this movie. But their ranks, in spite of the presence of fine actors like Laurence Fishburne, Harry Lennix and Harold Perrineau, become more robotic with every passing scene. The sole exception is Jada Pinkett Smith as the daredevil pilot Niobe, who brings a touch of bad-girl B-movie attitude into the humorless subterranean gloom. It is not altogether worthless: the Wachowski Brothers still know how to stage an action sequence, and there are some scenes that have a quiet, mysterious beauty. If they would only let go of their grandiose theological pretensions, they might once again be interesting filmmakers. — A. O. Scott",15513,1

Jason Schwartzman is a college dropout on a downhill spiral; John Leguizamo a paranoid drug dealer named Spider Mike and Mena Suvari his strung-out girlfriend; Brittany Murphy a stripper who snorts speed; and Mickey Rourke, in a swaggering macho turn, the cowboy chemist who cooks up the poison.

At the center of the film is Wei (Wei Minzhi), a 13-year-old primary school graduate who has been pressed into service as a substitute teacher in the Shuiquan Primary School. When one of her students is sent to the city to work off his parents' debts. Wei, who has been promised a bonus if she can keep her class intact (this is the source of the film's title), sets out to bring him home. And the movie, which has so far been a slow, touching study of village life, becomes something else: a work of lyrical realism that has some of the shattering, redemptive power of Vittorio De Sica's ''Bicycle Thief.'' &#151; A.O.

"Most of what we see of Mark (Gator) Rogowski, the fallen skateboarding star who is the focus of Helen Stickler's lively, cool-headed documentary film are vintage clips of the charismatic young athlete near the peak of his fame in the late 1980's. That's because Mr. Rogowski, who is serving a 31-year-to-life sentence for a murder he committed in 1991,  wasn't permitted to be filmed. But his contrite voice is heard in a recent tape-recorded phone call from prison.  This remembrance of Mr. Rogowski in his glory days, when he pushed the boundaries of vertical skateboarding to daredevil extremes, is the latest variation on a theme that &quot;Behind the Music&quot; has turned into a cliché: stardom can be  toxic; the younger the celebrity the greater the risk.

"&quot;Girlhood&quot; is prefaced  with an unsettling statistic: in the past decade, the number of violent assaults by underage  girls in this country has doubled. The film then narrows its focus to concentrate on the  lives of two teenagers, Shanae Owens and Megan Jensen, both incarcerated for assault at  the Waxter Juvenile Facility, in Baltimore. The film follows Shanae and Megan over  three years, beginning in 1999. Both are likable, smart young women struggling to  overcome traumatic backgrounds. Shanae, at the age of 11, stabbed another girl to death  in a knife fight. Megan, abandoned by a drug-addicted mother who has spent years in  prison, attacked another girl with a box cutter. The hard-headed film suggests (without  insisting) that a stable maternal guidance is a key to salvation. &#151; Stephen Holden",15553,1

In portraying a spoiled teenage girl who wakes up in the body of a 30-year-old man, Mr. Schneider could have taken any number of potentially offensive tacks. Instead, he brings an almost doelike sweetness to the role of Jessica, a snooty high school cheerleader whose world suddenly shatters when she loses half a pair of stolen earrings that carry an ancient African curse. When a scruffy petty criminal discovers the lost earring at a gas station and tries it on, the two exchange bodies.

Maddy's mother, Molly (Jennifer Beals), is a security expert who has just designed a fiendishly complicated vault for a greedy, cold-hearted banker (Michael Des Barres).  The fact that Maddy's father is a nice guy and the banker is not seems to be more than enough moral justification for screenwriters Michael Brandt and Derek Haas, authors of that finely nuanced study in ethics and responsibility, &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious.&quot; Based on a Danish children's film, &quot;Klatretosen,&quot; &quot;Catch That Kid&quot; is the first mainstream studio movie from Bart Freundlich, who made &quot;The Myth of Fingerprints&quot; and &quot;World Traveler&quot; as an independent.

"An indigestible Christmas pudding from the British whimsy factory responsible for such reasonably palatable confections as &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral,&quot; &quot;Notting Hill&quot; and &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary.&quot; A romantic comedy swollen to the length of an Oscar-trolling epic — nearly two and a quarter hours of cheekiness, diffidence and high-toned smirking — Richard Curtis's film is more like a record label's greatest-hits compilation or a &quot;very special&quot; sitcom clip-reel show than an actual movie. A sparkling Anglo-American cast of newly minted and long familiar stars chirps, swoons, pines, quips and sheds the odd tear. Presiding over it all is the new Prime Minister, a twinkly bachelor with a tonsorial resemblance to Tony Blair, who is played by none other than Hugh Grant. He is just one of a number of men (Alan Rickman and Colin Firth are the others) who fall for younger women in their employ. Another half-dozen subplots are strewn hither and yon as the movie swerves between cynicism and maudlin sentiment, oblivious to its own sleaziness and dishonesty. The only genuine comic spark comes from Bill Nighy, as a washed-up rock star trying to make a comeback with a treacly Christmas single. The song, he's happy to admit, is rubbish.

"Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman have never shared the screen before, as they do in this latest film adaptation of a paranoiac John Grisham courtroom potboiler. Yet, something feels familiar about the picture — Mr. Hackman has played this grubby-souled, hand-tailored heart of modern corruption before, and in a previous Grisham adaptation: &quot;The Firm.&quot; This time, he's a slick jury consultant named Rankin Fitch who employs ruthless tactics to empanel a jury that will best service his client. And like &quot;The Firm,&quot; the schematic crassness of the narrative provides an actor the opportunity to deliver some fine work. John Cusack gives one of his wiliest performances in some time, and one of his most adult, as the aging slacker who is drafted into jury duty. Apparently, the writers realize there's not much to be done with the boilerplate narrative, which involves the machinations of  the jury that Fitch is laboring to bend to his own will. (Mr. Hoffman is the endearing plaintiff attorney.) You may end up wishing that the actors had found a less needlessly showoffy picture to practice their craft. Especially since half the time, they're filmed as if they were in the director's way. Gary Fleder tries to boldface his assets, though in doing so, he undermines the picture; he stages &quot;Jury&quot; as if it were an episode of &quot;CSI.&quot; — Elvis Mitchell",15653,1

"Robert Greenwald's sober, meticulous film about the Bush administration's selling of the Iraqi war disdains Michael Moore-ish stunts.  Instead, it patiently chronicles the ever-shifting case for war made by the President and his close advisers, noting every step on the way from blunt assertions that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, through the long period of hedging (make that &quot;weapons of mass destruction-related activities&quot;) and up to the current administration position &#151; that even if there never were any such weapons, Saddam was a bad man and the world is better off without him.  Rather than attempt a sweeping indictment of the Bush Administration and all that it stands for, Mr. Greenwald focuses on a simple, demonstrable point:  that the war in Iraq was sold to Congress and the American public through a coordinated series of public misstatements that at best look like wishful thinking and at worst like outright deception. &#151; Dave Kehr",15667,1

With its murky chiaroscuro and fascination with machines (which it renders with far more precision than it does the faces of its characters) and brooding electronic score, the film, set in Tokyo in the near future, sustains a heady noirish atmosphere that might be called Technomood. A tangled modern police drama folded into an old-fashioned monster movie with echoes of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;King Kong,&quot; the film is the third cinematic spinoff from the successful &quot;Patlabor&quot; franchise. &#151; Stephen Holden",15670,1

But Emily also has a sideline. Operating as the neighborhood shrink for 50 cents a session, she offers to hear the confessions of the neighborhood kids. Emily, however, has a somewhat larger secret of her own. Her mother is expecting a baby, which will be her first biological child because, as it turns out, Emily was adopted.

"The remote outpost that a dwarf named Fin (Peter Dinklage) settles into, a rundown train depot in the wilds of New Jersey, is such a restful space that it seems perfect for him. Tom McCarthy has such an appreciation for quiet that it occupies the same space as a character in this film, a delicate, thoughtful and often hilarious take on loneliness.  Fin, with his low, rational voice and intense stare, has moved into the small spot after he inherits it. Mr. McCarthy treats Fin's new life as if his protagonist were emerging from underwater and must adjust to the onrush of aural assault. Much of it comes from Joe (Bobby Cannavale), the relentlessly friendly and talky Cuban who pulls up every day in his food truck to run what must be the loneliest retail location not staffed by a Maytag salesman. Hawking coffee and fanning up a cloud of busy, pushy and likable chatter, Joe elbows his way into the taciturn Fin's life. Mr. McCarthy wrings contrasts from the serene, diminutive Mr. Dinklage — whose dignity seems unassailable until finally ruffled, when he lets loose a thunderbolt of hostility — and the big, buffed Cannavale, whose unremitting volubility is sheer charm. Their relationship is goofily enthralling. A movie about a dwarf certainly flirts with being cringe-worthy, at least in the abstract, but Mr. McCarthy deals with his creations as characters. What's most important about Fin is the detachment he imposes on himself — his resignation with loneliness. — Elvis Mitchell",15817,1
"Ewan MacGregor plays Joe, a moody, literary young man in postwar Glasgow who works on a barge and seduces women as much out of boredom as out of lust. One day Joe and his boss, whose unhappy wife (Tilda Swinton) Joe has been sleeping with, fish a dead body out of the water, an event which precipitates something of a crisis in Joe's slack, selfish life. In a discontinuous series of flashbacks, we revisit his relationship with Cathie (Emily Mortimer), from the first flirtation on the beach to a fateful encounter on the docks. Based on a novel by Alex Trocchi, the film is all mood and attitude, a dated exercise in existentialist angry-young-man noir. It follows its literary source in assuming, rather than showing, that Joe's narcissism and indifference to other people offer deep insights into the human condition. — A. O. Scott",15818,1

It is less disturbing than his horror films (of which the notorious &quot;Audition&quot; is perhaps the best known), but what it lacks in violence it makes up for in surreal invention. Two yakuzas travel to a remote city, where one of them promptly disappears, only to reappear in — and then, after an astonishing scene of obstetric extremity, out of — the body of a young woman. In the meantime, there is plenty of strangeness to hold your attention: a lactating woman, a gangster who uses serving spoons as sexual aids, and a figure with the head of a cow and a very slimy tongue. The film's title means &quot;Cow Head,&quot; which clarifies matters only slightly. — A. O. Scott",15822,1

This is an accomplishment of sorts, generally the sort that no one plans. The director, John Lee Hancock, strains so mightily to bring a human aspect to the material that the movie limps as if it has a pulled muscle. The film can't support the burden of delivering a drama with a mammoth running time, a climactic catastrophe that nearly every American knows, and no women with major speaking roles. — Elvis Mitchell",15869,1

Many of the faces that emerge through the murk appear bug-eyed. And much of the dialogue, which is frequently  shouted, is only semi-intelligible.

"This wistful soft-edged portrait of Rodney Bingenheimer, the  elfin, vacant-eyed waif who presided for more two decades as a social impresario of the  Los Angeles rock scene, keeps its claws carefully retracted but still leaves a bitter  aftertaste. At the peak of his influence as a nightclub impresario and disc jockey, Mr.  Bingenheimer, a quiet, wizened gnome of indeterminate age with a pageboy haircut, was  a gatekeeper to the rock royalty. The movie is crammed with vintage photos and film  clips of Mr. Bingenheimer escorting beautiful girls and celebrities into his so-called  English disco, the tiny Los Angeles club he established during the heyday of British  glam-rock. Hollywood is well stocked with oddballs like Mr. Bingenheimer who glean  their self-worth from access to celebrity. But fame, observed up close, is a cold and  voracious entity, and the &quot;Mayor of the Sunset Strip,&quot; almost without trying, makes you  feel its chilly pull. — Stephen Holden",15924,1

But the film's name refers to the taciturn, devoted &#151; and impoverished &#151; family man Seibei Iguchi (Hiroyuki Sanada), who dashes home at twilight to spend time with his young daughters and ailing mother. Yet the associations of &quot;Samurai&quot; do eventually pay off &#151; a tense and compact sword battle, tinted with anxiety and regret, gives the last act a sizzling muscularity.  In his ratty and worn kimono, the sensitive, quiet Seibei smells like he's been fighting for days; his lack of personal hygiene &#151; or interest in a nightlife &#151; makes him the object of scorn and ridicule from his bookkeeping co-workers. Then an old girlfriend, the delicate and sweet Tomoe (the precise Rie Miyazama) re-enters Seibei's life &#151; and brings a complicated domestic history with her &#151; which allows Mr. Yamada to meticulously create a tableau wracked with internal and external pressures. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",15939,1
"The directorial debut of the novelist-screenwriter Sherman Alexie is an often affecting, low-budget melodrama that is occasionally sabotaged by its economy of means: the image quality is sometimes so poor that it's like watching the pixel breakup on digital cable. But although the film is initially clumsy and a little hard to follow, Mr. Alexie takes his time in setting his characters in play, and the visual clunkiness becomes secondary to the eloquent emotional desolation. The film's narrative is told mostly from the perspective of Seymour Polatkin (Evan Adams), a gay writer and poet and a member of the Spokane tribe.  &quot;Fancydancing&quot; is difficult material — a drama about self-destructiveness — and the novice director is sometimes tangled in the biggest trap inherent in such a project. Presenting such a motif means that almost everybody on screen sees himself as a victim and is prone to displays of sloppy articulation about self-loathing. — Elvis Mitchell",15940,1
"At 29, Alejandro Amenabar, a Spanish filmmaker directing his first English-language movie, shows an impressive mastery of the ghost-story form. He sends his camera down shadowy corridors and into cavernous rooms to create a mood of elegant dread. Though a bit too long, and too cluttered in the middle, &quot;The Others&quot; is persuasively spooky, and even manages to be poignant, thanks to a fierce performance by Nicole Kidman. She plays a woman living with her two children and three peculiar servants in a fog-shrouded house on the island of Jersey, in the English Channel. - A. O. Scott",15941,1
"Now in its fourth installment, the &quot;Boys Life&quot; series from Strand Releasing unites a group of gay-themed shorts into a feature-length passage.  But where previous editions have contained six or seven short films, &quot;Boys Life 4: Four Play&quot; requires only four titles to achieve an 87-minute running time, a sign of how much more substantial and ambitious work in the field has become.  It has also become much less overtly political.  Where much of the gay cinema of a decade ago was devoted to provocation and polemics, the films in this package tend toward more naturalistic comedy and drama, trading slogans for complex emotions. &#151; Dave Kehr",15942,1

Takashi Miike's episodic film follows the efforts of Mario and Kei to obtain safe passage out of Japan, which no longer wants them after Mario hijacked a helicopter and used it to free Kei from a prison transport bus. &quot;The City of Lost Souls&quot; is Tokyo, portrayed as an attractive carnival of neon lights and tiny, beguiling side streets. The lost souls, presumably, are those who are indifferent to the fate of Mr. Miike's Bonnie-and-Clyde couple, who express their romantic nonconformity by killing almost everyone who crosses their path. — Dave Kehr",15963,1

This Argentine movie is the directorial debut of a filmmaker who appears to have steeped himself so thoroughly in Alfred Hitchcock and David Mamet that it's hard to imagine &quot;Nine Queens&quot; having been made without them leering metaphorically over his shoulder. The movie combines Hitchcock's winking tongue-in-cheek vision of a paranoid universe where everyone may be part of an elaborate conspiracy with Mr. Mamet's obsession with the finer points of gamesmanship and con artistry. — Stephen Holden",16028,1

"Thom Andersen, a long-time resident of Los Angeles who teaches film and video at CalArts, defends his hometown against its misrepesentation by Hollywood in this long, frequently fascinating essay in urban history and media criticism. Using clips from more than 200 movies, he shows how they have distorted and mystified the city's architecture, its politics and its racially and economically fractured social relations. At times, the scenes culled from films noirs, action pictures and cop movies seem like elaborate annotations of the obvious. It is hard to be shocked by the news that movies distort reality. But Mr. Andersen's dry wit, his eye for detail and his plainspoken erudition yield some fascinating insights. And the movies themselves undermine his critique by making the film not only thought-provoking, but also compulsively watchable. — A. O. Scott",16041,1

"This film, shown at the Cannes and New York film festivals, completes Jean-Luc Godard's journey from one of the cinema's great radicals to one of its crankiest reactionaries. His artistry remains impressive: the first half, a lustrous 35-millimeter black-and-white Paris nocturne, is almost matched in its visual beauty by the second, a brightly colored digital video pastoral shot on the Breton coast. But it is compromised by a tired polemic against the United States, Steven Spielberg, and the whole modern world. &quot;Polemic&quot; may be the wrong word, since it implies an argument and a point of view. Instead, what is on display here is an attitude of complacent, Olympian disdain, the sad, at times even touching spectacle of an artist mourning his own lost relevance. — A. O. Scott",16053,1

Timothy Spall and Lesley Manville play the depressed, bickering couple at the center of the drama, whose love for each other has been ground down by the routines of work and the unpleasantness of their children. But though the members of this family &#151; and the neighbors and coworkers whose equally unhappy lives round out the movie &#151; are frequently shown at their worst, it is impossible not to identify with them, or to love them as Mr. Leigh does. His tough, democratic generosity of spirit is evident in every frame. — A. O. Scott",16058,1

"Following the movement of the seasons from autumn to summer, Nicolas Philibert's quiet documentary chronicles a year in the classroom of Georges Lopez, a humane, infinitely patient teacher who runs a one-room schoolhouse in rural France. At the end of a long and devoted career, Mr. Lopez manages the day-to-day travails of his profession with solemnity and persistence, breaking up fights, helping initiate the youngest students into the rigors of the French academic system and preparing the older ones to go on to the next stage, a large, impersonal regional middle school. While the film does inquire discreetly into the sometimes dysfunctional home lives of some of the children, it is less a social document than a portrait of an artist: Mr. Lopez's mixture of discipline and inspiration surely merits that description. As such it is tremendously affecting without ever seeming platitudinous or sentimental. — A.O. Scott",16060,1

Wes Craven and his group recognize that the franchise's real competition is not the recent hit films ''The Blair Witch Project'' or ''The Sixth Sense,'' but rather ''Scream'' itself. ''Scream 3'' doesn't skimp on jacked-up scares, but it's as much as personality show as it is a slasher film. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",16066,1

A big man, Mr. Affleck is shriveled by the one-dimensional role. Even his scarlet leather outfit makes him diminutive.

"André Téchiné's taut, swift wartime drama, set in the early days of the German  occupation of France, begins with a montage of devastating black-and-white news clips  interwoven with flashes of the flight south of a terrified young widow (Emmanuelle Béart) and her  two children, a 13-year-old boy (Gregoire Leprince-Ringuet) and 7-year-old girl (Clemence Meyer). When a German air strike leaves the family car a burnt-out shell, a boyish young stranger (Gaspard Ulleil) guides them into the woods where they find  refuge in a grand abandoned house. The movie plays multiple variations on the theme of initiation, as the foursome improvises a structured family life and delicately lays out  fundamental conflicts: between survivalist and bourgeois perspectives; between wartime  and peacetime expectations; between habitually clinging to family values and fending for  yourself. Until their precarious idyll is finally interrupted, each of the four is forced to stretch and grow up in uncomfortable ways. — Stephen Holden",16097,1

With the real prince unavailable, why not create a facsimile from another country and bring him to America? The soggy contemporary fairy tale is a cinematic cream puff with a melted marshmallow inside it. As the temperature rises, the whole gooey thing starts to melt. Julia Stiles's heroine is a model of integrity and decency who seems anachronistic in the age of Britney and Christina, especially when she has to choose between marrying the love of her life and becoming the Queen of Denmark and going to medical school.

"Can a vain, luxury-loving beautician in flight from an abusive husband find happiness with a dour, hound-dog-faced manufacturer of frozen foods who suffers from crippling panic attacks? That's the less-than-burning question posed by &quot;Jet Lag,'' a peppy romantic trifle from France that rises above the mundane on the strength of its beautifully detailed lead performances. The potential sweethearts, Rose (Juliette Binoche) and Felix (Jean Reno), find themselves stranded at Roissy-Charles De  Gaulle Airport in Paris during an air traffic nightmare. A relationship that begins with the borrowing of a cellphone turns into a shared overnight stay in a hotel, during which the strangers squabble, then begin to bond. Because the screenplay is as canny about human nature as the two stars, this odd couple's romantic rapprochement is surprisingly credible. ï¿½ Stephen Holden",16134,1

The finished album is rejected by the band's record company, Reprise, which leads to some serious internal strain. Jeff Tweedy, Wilco's lead singer and chief songwriter, comes to feel that he can no longer work with the guitarist Jay Bennett and fires him. The happy ending is preordained: fans of the band will know that the album was eventually released by Nonesuch and became a success.

Mr. Daum fears his children have turned their backs on the non-Jewish world, regarding all gentiles with suspicion bordering on hate.  By asking the two on a trip to Poland, where they discover that the Polish couple who hid Mr. Daum's father-in-law and two brothers are still alive, Mr. Daum hopes to shake his sons from their separatism, but even when confronted by such compelling, living evidence of goodness in the non-Jewish world, neither one is willing to abandon his prejudices.  The film offers no answers and is all the more moving for it; Mr. Daum's honest befuddlement seems apt, true and distressing. — Dave Kehr",16144,1

"He said he would be back, didn't he? And so Arnold Schwarzeneggar returns once more from the future to deliver one-liners with his trademark leaden  whimsy. It has been 12 years since the last &quot;Terminator&quot; movie, and  nearly 20 since the first, and the franchise risks a certain obsolescence. As does the old T-1 himself; his nemesis this time is a sleek new model, T-X cyborg human-hunter (Kristanna Loken), who turns up naked on Rodeo  Drive and proceeds to wreak havoc in a red leather pants suit and a Lexus  sports coupe. Jonathan Mostow lacks the operatic humanism of James Cameron, who made the first two episodes, but he brings an air of unassuming B-movie  competence to the many chase and explosion scenes. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are the future resistance leaders whom the good terminator must protect from the bad one. They also must try to short-circuit the evil machine's takeover of the world, and the annihilation of most of its human population. All in under two hours. — A.O. Scott",16146,1

His feverish act, driven by the sizzle of samba, is a glittering, sweat-drenched celebration of the body with  songs and stories that match the wildest inventions of Scheherezade. We meet  Francisco's extended family (a prostitute, her baby and their live-in slave) and one of his  lovers. Fueled by Lázaro Ramos's incandescent performance, the movie creates a romantic  vision of a bygone urban demimonde with many resemblances to Jean Genet's Parisian  underworld. — Stephen Holden",16148,1

"A strictly formulaic action picture that suggests some of Arnold Schwarzenegger's early, low-budget vehicles, such as &quot;Commando&quot; (1985) and &quot;Raw Deal&quot; (1986).  The Rock plays Beck (no first name), a reluctant enforcer for a Los Angeles loan shark who is sent to the jungles of Brazil (though the film was shot in Hawaii) to retrieve his boss's son, Travis (Seann William Scott, of the &quot;American Pie&quot; series). But Travis isn't eager to return, having discovered the location of a valuable golden idol, cunningly concealed for centuries in a hidden, booby-trapped cave.  Hatcher (Christopher Walken), the cynical American who owns and operates a hellish open pit gold mine in the area, is also after Travis's secret, as is Mariana (Rosario Dawson), a local beauty who owns a bar but harbors a big secret of her own.

Guilt-free and nearly devoid of erotic angst, &quot;About Adam&quot; is the flip side of movies like &quot;Teorema,&quot; &quot;Something for Everyone&quot; and those slogging Tennessee Williams dramas in which an irresistible, omnisexual stud is often an angel of death.

"This documentary could just as easily have used the title of a recent potboiler: &quot;Identity.'' And though the ever-deepening story takes its name from Edith Hahn-Beer's autobiographical 1999 book, &quot;The Nazi Officer's Wife: How One Jewish Woman Survived the Holocaust,'' questions of identity - and the continual submersion of self to stay alive - are the heart of the story. &quot;Edith Hahn willed herself to disappear,'' says the narrator, Susan Sarandon. It is a bewitching and harrowing tale, told by the woman who survived the impostures in which she cloaked herself. The narrative has the engrossing folds and twists of a novel. Hahn-Beer loses her true love to cowardice, her mother to the Nazis. Years later, she gains a family of her own, after assuming the identity of an Aryan she knew years earlier. She burrows so completely into this falsehood that she marries a kind German, who's also a Nazi sympathizer. (By the end of the war, he's drafted and she takes on the absurd and frightening position of the title of her book.) And she so deeply sublimates her feisty, fiery personality in playing the role of a compliant wife that she comes to love her second existence. Finally, what threatens to become a life sentence of self-abnegation is commuted because the man who loved Hahn-Beer and abandoned her earlier persuaded the young woman into hiding her real identity papers in the lining of a book. Despite the dramatic sweep of her life, the actual threat of extermination for Hahn-Beer, a law student in her late 20's who endured in Nazi Germany by secreting away much of herself, gives the movie a grave, transfixing air of real-life existentialism. — Elvis Mitchell",16187,1

"This World War II action comedy is even more of a drag than its weary premise suggests. The picture's elements finally fall into place about 40 minutes into it &#151; a big burden on a film that runs only 99 minutes. It's about a small group of soldiers assigned to infiltrate a factory in Nazi Germany that manufactures the Enigma code machine.  Since all of the able-bodied German men were off fighting by 1944, when this movie takes place, the factories employ only women, so the Allied soldiers assigned to retrieve one of these devices have to dress as women. &quot;All the Queen's Men&quot; is jaw-droppingly superficial, straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as John Ritter's glory days on &quot;Three's Company.&quot; &#151; Elvis Mitchell",16211,1

A gripping step-by-step account of the case mounted by a Spanish judge against the former Chilean military dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet for human rights abuses, the movie re-examines one of the most painful episodes of recent Latin American history and its aftermath. Sober political and legal analysis alternates with grim first-hand accounts of torture and murder in a film that has the structure of a choral symphony that swells to a bittersweet finale. &quot;The Pinochet Case&quot; is a beautifully layered mosaic that is all the more powerful for never raising its voice to a shout and for keeping the tears to a minimum. — Stephen Holden",16225,1

The movie offers two auspicious debuts: Denzel Washington's as a first-rate director of actors, and  Derek Luke's as Antwone, an angry young sailor who with the help of a navy psychiatrist  (Mr. Washington) begins to heal many of his childhood wounds. Those wounds run deep for a character who was born in prison and brought up in a foster home where he endured  physical and sexual abuse. The film takes pains to portray that abuse (which involved racial insults) as belonging to a pattern of social dysfunction instilled in African-Americans by white slaveowners and passed down through the generations. — Stephen Holden",16232,1

"&quot;Esther Kahn&quot; wants to explore the nature of performance by presenting an extreme case: a person who is present to herself only when pretending to be someone else, and whose counterfeit emotions carry more truth than the plain speech of the people who surround her. The problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise, the director, Arnaud Desplechin, is content to state it. At crucial moments, instead of showing us what Esther (Summer Phoenix) does onstage, he resorts to voice-over narration to explain what we are supposed to be seeing. But for Esther's character to make sense, for her to be something more than a moody, baffled zombie, the transformation that takes place must be palpable and vivid. – A. O. Scott",16239,1

"This gay romantic melodrama draws on an unconscionable number of conventions, but works in the end because of its commitment to its characters and a handful of fine performances. Christian, played by the former soap opera star Wes Ramsey, is that stock figure of gay drama, the hopelessly handsome party boy whose life is devoted to casual sex.  A waiter in a Los Angeles restaurant, owned and operated by the radiantly maternal Lila (the always welcome Jacqueline Bisset), Christian accepts a $50 wager from his co-workers that he will be able to seduce the apparently straight Mormon missionary, Aaron (Steve Sandvoss), who has moved into the apartment opposite his.  Needless to say, what begins as a cynical bet develops into a deep romance.  After some initial resistance, Aaron surrenders to Christian's charms, discovering his own homosexuality in the process.  At the same time, Christian discovers, in Aaron's sincerity and innocence, the deeper values that have been missing from his own life.  The writer-director, C. Jay Cox, knows his formulas a bit too well for his own good, and the film's reliance on coincidence and contrivance, particularly in its forced final third, gets in the way of his low key, naturalistic direction. &#151; Dave Kehr",16277,1

Though its conclusion is too tidily therapeutic, and though elements of its story strain credibility, &quot;Moonlight Mile&quot; has an understated, lived-in quality, and a wry, unforced sense of the absurd. The soundtrack, of early 1970's album cuts certainly helps.  Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as the fianc&#233;, in particular, is smart and unpredictable, a portrait of Vietnam-era youthful indecision that reminds you of the young Dustin Hoffman.

Mr. Kitano directed, edited and wrote &quot;Brother&quot; (aniki is Japanese for brother), and his style of close-to-the-vest brutality travels extremely well. Aniki ends up in the United States, fleeing waves of trouble left in his wake in Japan, where the murder of his boss has caused a gang war. He transplants himself to Los Angeles, where his half-brother Ken (Claude Maki) is a small-time drug dealer who runs with a crew of lowlifes who seem to be even worse at a criminal lifestyle than he is. Soon, Aniki and his New World pickup crew are dropping some Old World vengeance on any pack of criminals in their way and setting into motion the kind of forces that will demand addressing. Though this is territory that Mr. Kitano has covered before, he underlines the differences between Japan and the United States to make dramatic points and give his solemn toughness a context. - Elvis Mitchell",16374,1

"A bizarre exercise in autobiographical filmmaking &#151; some indelicate souls might call it a vanity project &#151;  &quot;Emerald Cowboy&quot; relates the adventurous life of Eishy Hayata, a Japanese-American who became one of the leading emerald dealers (esmeralderos) in conflict-torn Colombia. &quot;Emerald Cowboy&quot; must surely occupy a unique place in film history, perhaps as the most solipsistic film ever made. Mr. Hayata is the executive producer, and his daughter, Eva Hayata, a co-producer; the script is adapted by Mr. Hayata from his autobiography; and the film stars Mr. Hayata as himself, at least in the present-day sequences. At the very least, its existence is a tribute to Mr. Hayata's financial success in his chosen field, since it has very little reason to exist otherwise. Though Mr. Hayata seems convinced that he is a colorful, romantic figure, the movie itself is crushingly mundane and is unlikely to attract any audience beyond close relatives. &#151; Dave Kehr",16376,1

The film is structured as a journey, from Iranian Kurdistan to Iraqi Kurdistan, undertaken by a locally famous singer, Mizra (Shahab Ebrahimi) and his two adult sons, Barat (Faegh. Mohammadi) and Audeh (Allah-Morad Rashtian), in search of Mizra's ex-wife, Hanareh, a singer who left for Iraq after the Iranian revolution prohibited her from performing in public.

But for all the fun it kicks up, the movie feels bloated and chaotic. Mike Myers adds a dull fourth character, the villainous Goldmember, to a repertory that already includes Austin, Dr. Evil and Fat  Bastard. Michael Caine appears as Austin's suave, still-swinging father, the British  master spy Nigel Powers, and Beyonce Knowles of the pop group Destiny Child is a Pam Grier parody named Foxxy Cleopatra. What holds it all together is the manic  exuberance of Mr. Myers's imaginary world, which suggests a Pee-Wee's Playhouse for eternal adolescents. — Stephen Holden",16412,1

Of the five, only one  remained an outdoorsman.. The other four are solid citizens, married or divorced, with  children and leading complicated but reasonably happy grown-up lives. What leaves you  feeling wistful is the movie's exposure of the ravages of time on the human body (they  were once so beautiful and ecstatic) and a sense of &quot;is that all there is?&quot; when it comes to  growing up. — Stephen Holden",16418,1

The Reaper strain, a mutation in the vampire gene, has resulted in a new species of super-vampires.  Those carrying the gene are risks to ordinary vampires and humans, especially since conventional anti-vampire weapons won't do them in.  This installment in the life of Blade, the fearless vampire slayer, is dense on imagery, mood and plot. Happily, it exults in its lurid and gruesome absurdity. Because of the movie's wonderful shamelessness, its mordantly funny chills and fights are huge turn-ons. A B picture in love with the zest of its comic-book origins, it embodies that medium's pulse-pounding spiritedness and silliness. — Elvis Mitchell",16422,1

Poorly transferred to film from low-definition video, &quot;Bonjour, Monsieur Shlomi&quot; looks awful on the big screen.  Shemi Zarhin, who wrote and directed, matches the banality of his screenplay with the impersonality of his filmmaking.

With shaggy, baggy looks that belie his performance's fine comic control, Jeff Bridges plays a guy who truly deserves to be called Dude, and is by turns oblivious and indignant once a ruined rug leads him into neo-noir escapades.

"The marketers of &quot;Mambo Italiano&quot; would like nothing more than to position it as a broad, sloppy, ethnic comedy-romance in the recently minted tradition of &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding.&quot; The hero and narrator of &quot;Mambo Italiano&quot; is Angelo Barberini (Luke Kirby), a sweet-faced young resident of Montreal's Italian neighborhood once mercilessly tormented by his high-school peers for his supposedly effeminate behavior. As the film opens he has grown into a full-fledged gay man, though he is still living in the home of his parents, Maria (Ginette Reno) and Gino (Paul Sorvino). Angelo finally works up the courage to move out of his parents' home and into an apartment he shares with Nino (Peter Miller), a closeted Montreal cop. The problem for Angelo and Nino: how to keep their loving relationship a secret from their volatile parents, who are still eagerly fixing them up with &quot;nice Italian girls.&quot; Émile Gaudreault's direction is about as basic as you can get: his film consists almost entirely of close-ups, with a cut from one character to the next at the end of every line. The accents wobble from the Chico Marx delivery of Mr. Sorvino to the distinctly French-inflected line readings of some of the local actors. As Angelo, Mr. Kirby has a boyish charm, which is probably the best that can be said for this film as well. — Dave Kehr",16534,1

Based on a short story by James Lasdun, &quot;Besieged&quot; is a film of few words and powerful images. (Especially of a military coup in a poor African country.) The love is sealed through an extraordinary act of self-sacrifice and a deepening appreciation of each other's tastes in music.

"Somebody needed to make a comedy built around all of the holiday season hostility that goes up along with the decorations this time of year. The light-fingered director Terry Zwigoff and the screenwriters Glenn Ficarra and John Requa are just the guys for such a task. &quot;Bad Santa&quot; takes all of the Christmas season's bad vibes and converts them into an achingly funny and corrupt dark comedy. Billy Bob Thornton is Willie T. Stokes, a burned-out, hard-drinking safecracker who's annually roused from sleeping one off during the most wonderful time of the year by his dwarf partner, Marcus (Tony Cox). As Marcus works as a department store elf, he also cases the store so that he and Willie can break in and relieve the joint of valuable merchandise. On this tour, they've ended up in Phoenix, which just adds to the wealth of hilarious incongruity. As a director, Mr. Zwigoff has a taste for finding the dramatic power of self-loathing and making it entertainment. His previous films, the documentary &quot;Crumb&quot; and the his fiction-film debut &quot;Ghost World,&quot; both hinged on coping with epic tides of depression. &quot;Santa&quot; falls directly into that lineage. Mr. Thornton's face is drawn into a rictus of a snarl; his Willie anticipates trouble, and when it doesn't crop up on its own, he has to stir it up from the bottom of the pot.  Willie is filled with the most distorted kind of narcissism imaginable, and for Mr. Thornton, it functions as a kind of star chemistry. Willie ladles it generously on the kids who line up to see him on his wobbly perch on Santa's throne: he's the kind of minimum-wage offal who has sent his victims on to thousands of hours of therapy. —  Elvis Mitchell",16613,1

Scott Hamilton Kennedy Kennedy, tracing their sometimes bumpy progress toward opening night, observes their lives with sympathy and tact, and does the students the courtesy of allowing them to explain themselves, which they do with candor, heart and humor. &#151; A.O.

"The sight of surfers gracefully navigating 50-foot waves, then being swallowed into the surge only to emerge in triumph is a surefire thrill that exerts the same visceral tug as watching storm chasers drive into tornados. Even vicariously you can feel the rushes of adrenaline.  Because the waves get progressively higher as &quot;Riding Giants&quot; goes along, some of that thrill is sustained, although the movie is too long. For all its excitement, Stacy Peralta's follow-up to his skateboarding movie &quot;Dogtown and Z-Boys&quot; lacks the quirky, personal touch of its forerunner. Though it has its share of cheek, it is a more formal survey of a sport that is already well documented. The history of surfing, one commentator remarks, can be divided into eras: before and after &quot;Gidget.&quot; The closer the movie draws to the present, the more concentrated is its attention to innovative stars like Greg Noll, Jeff  Clark and Laird Hamilton and their quest to ride the biggest, scariest waves. &#151; Stephen Holden",16632,1
"The portrait of Platon Makovksi (Vladimir Mashkov), a shady capitalist wheeler-dealer and economic kingpin in post-Communist Russia, roughly parallels the rise of the notorious Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky. This two-hour-plus movie wants to be an Eastern European answer to &quot;The Godfather,&quot; and every now and then it lives up to that promise. The movie is fueled by Mr. Mashkov's  blazing portrayal of Platon, a brilliant, charming, schemer and prankster whose high-rolling way of life eventually closes in around him. The tone of the narrative, which confusingly darts around in time, suggests a jazzy, comically edged film noir. If the movie feels convincingly wired to the moment, it is finally too scatterbrained and anecdotal for the strands of its story to cohere into more than an intriguing jumble. — Stephen Holden",16633,1

"Jean-Claude Brisseau's French film is a frequently overheated, often delirious fantasy about two Parisiennes in their early 20's, the exotic dancer Natalie (Coralie Revel) and the shy suburbanite Sandrine (Sabrina Seyvecou). Co-workers in a strip club, the women become friends and roommates, as Natalie initiates the conservative, uncertain Sandrine into the pleasures of unbridled female sexuality.  But pleasure also becomes business, as the two young women resolve to use their sexual powers to conquer the male-dominated business world, embodied by a private bank where Sandrine gets a job as a secretary and begins seducing her way to the top. Mr. Brisseau may pay lip service to post-feminist ideas of female empowerment through seduction, though his actual concerns seem to be less intellectual than frankly carnal.  As the two friends compete to see who will be the first to conquer and tame the elusive Christophe (a Sadean libertine in his own right), Mr. Brisseau stages some rousingly voyeuristic sex scenes that, while they stop short of hardcore pornography, feature combinations seldom seen outside the oeuvre of Jenna Jameson.  Viewers of &quot;Secret Things&quot; will find it impossible not to allow a snicker to escape occasionally, as the film's lurid plotline unfolds into ever more preposterous developments.  But there is no denying the force of Mr. Brisseau's bizarre imagination and the personal conviction he brings to it. &#151; Dave Kehr",16667,1

The film is a sloppy, genial assemblage of furry special effects and fuzzy plot-lines as Mr. Murphy graciously allows himself to be upstaged by bears, raccoons and his own dog, Lucky. Toward the end, the half-baked Darwinism drifts unexpectedly into paw-in-the-air social realism as the woodland creatures, like the poultry in last year's superior &quot;Chicken Run,&quot; organize to fight their oppressors in a bizarre and curiously winning amalgam of environmental agitprop and barnyard comedy. - A.

"The story of Stephen Glass, a brilliant young journalist at the New Republic who turned out to be a profligate fabricator, might have inspired a dishy, cynical exposé of the insular, cut-throat world of magazine journalism. Instead, Billy Ray relates Glass's downfall with minimal embellishment and turns a tawdry anecdote into a sober, curiously thrilling examination of moral recklessness and office intrigue. What starts out as a sharp workplace comedy gradually darkens into a kind of managerial film noir as Glass (played with a perfect mixture of creepiness and charm by Hayden Christensen) is pursued by Charles Lane (Peter Sarsgaard), the magazine's editor and, in this version at least, the savior of its honor. With considerable ingenuity and wit, the movie's center of gravity shifts from Glass to Lane, and its ideas — about workplace loyalty, journalistic ethics, and the line between ambition and pathology — are all the more forceful for being delivered in a whisper. — A. O. Scott",16783,1
"No. 5 in the series of more-or-less animated feature films based on the diminishingly popular line of Japanese children's video games, &quot;Pokémon Heroes&quot; plays more like a catalog than a movie. The central human figure in the series is Ash Ketchum, a teenager who roams the world unburdened by parental supervision as he searches for more Pokémon to train and add to his collection (there are now more than 250 characters in the Pokémon universe).  He is aided by his first and finest Pokémon acquisition, Pikachu, a little yellow rabbit-like creature who emits devastating bolts of electricity when provoked. The film dutifully trots out several new additions to the PokÀemon product line — cute little &quot;pocket monsters&quot; that kids are encouraged to &quot;capture&quot; (i.e., purchase) — but is otherwise a tedious, unimaginative affair. — Dave Kehr",16784,1

Filmed at the public baths of Sofia, Bulgaria, in black and white, then tinted (in alternating episodes of sepia and blue), the film is set in a decaying storybook cityscape of once-grand structures rotting away in a perpetual downpour. With lavish sound effects but only the most fragmentary dialogue (in several languages), the film might be described as a silent film with sound. – Stephen Holden",16785,1

While incarcerated in a Borstal (a British reform school), the teenage Brendan (Shawn Hatosy) discovered the theater by reading Oscar Wilde, stood up to the institution's resident bully, tried and failed to escape, and formed two romantic relationships. By the end of the film, he has blossomed from an introverted rebel into an endearing, self-assured future Great Writer. – Stephen Holden",16800,1

"This stupendously entertaining movie, adapted from two of the novels in Patrick O'Brian's 20-volume maritime adventure series, celebrates an idea of England that might have seemed a bit corny even in 1805, when the action takes place, but that is brought to vibrant life thanks to Russell Crowe's commanding performance and Peter Weir's thoroughgoing mastery. Mr. Crowe plays Jack Aubrey, captain of the H.M.S. Surprise, a British frigate doing battle with a mysterious French battle ship off the Coast of South America. The combat scenes are shot with economy and vigor, but the most thrilling parts of the movie take place between skirmishes, when the complex system of authority and deference that runs the Surprise —  and the personality traits needed to keep it running —  is at the center of attention. The film's theme is the nature of authority, and Aubrey functions as a kind of ideal CEO: charismatic, tactically astute and able to instill in his sailors a sense of discipline and respect. Paul Bettany plays the ship's surgeon, Aubrey's best friend and foil, and the tension between them — between reason and duty, between intellect and action — gives the movie some unexpected dramatic depth. — A.

The movie follows several roving bands of boys and girls as they intermingle, often physically and in emotionally violent ways, and it chronicles the resultant power plays. The mounting insensitivity leads to a climax that's an adolescent version of a Hitchcock crime scene. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",16859,1

The essence of the story is a seething family drama of rivalries, jealousies  and betrayals that culminate with a &quot;Hamlet&quot;-like play-within-a-play.

Offering few laughs and a climactic scene of breathtaking cruelty, the plot-heavy movie draws you against your will into its malignant force field. Almost from the  beginning, the film's sugary and rancid strains work against each other. To put it another  way, &quot;Little Black Book&quot; would like to be a wised-up but still starry-eyed &quot;Working Girl&quot;  and a more acerbic &quot;Broadcast News.&quot; In trying to be both things at once, it can't hold a candle to either forerunner.

"This feature-length Disney western cartoon comedy is intermittently funny, but so pumped up for action that it may qualify for a slap on the wrist from Major League Baseball for banned substance abuse. At the very least, the movie may be the first film to require cortisone treatments from jamming its elbow in the audience's ribs so often. Roseanne Barr is the voice of Maggie, a show cow who's now homeless; her spiky, slightly sour delivery gives &quot;Range&quot; some needed breathing room. Her owner was forced to sell his farm after the rustler Alameda Slim (Randy Quaid) cleaned him out of cow and home. Maggie is deposited at Patch of Heaven, a dairy farm, where she meets up with two other heifers: the prim Brit Mrs. Caloway (Judi Dench) and Grace (Jennifer Tilly). When Patch of Heaven, also on the verge of failure, is about to be put on the auction block, Maggie convinces her new friends to capture Slim; the bounty on his head is just enough to save the farm from extinction. The laughs from the audience come at widely spaced intervals, since everyone is reacting to something entirely different; &quot;Range&quot; seems to exist in several time zones simultaneously. Unrestrained energy is hardly a bad thing for animation &#151; the best cartoons are built on the contradictory pursuit of meticulously arranged anarchy &#151; but they never seem needy, or desperate for laughs, as &quot;Home on the Range&quot; does. The film seems hungrier for a pat on the head than a chuckle. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",16900,1
"The first 3-D animated film from France, this outer-space fantasy, about a plucky teenage girl (Kirsten Dunst in the English-language version) struggling to save her planet from destruction, is thick with distracting visual detail, to the point where it is often hard to distinguish the characters from the digital underbrush. The plotting, too, is needlessly dense, which necessitates long, static sequences in which the characters fill one another in on the story and still manage to leave the viewer behind. A gallant effort, technically at least, but a fatally uninvolving movie. &#151; Dave Kehr",16901,1

"&quot;Joe Dirt&quot; stars a self-consciously poignant David Spade as a man who was abandoned by his parents during a family trip to the Grand Canyon when he was a boy. When he emerged from digging through a garbage can, he was alone. He's spent the rest of his life trying to find his family, a feat made all the more difficult because he can't remember his last name, which isn't really Dirt. The film, written by Mr. Spade and Fred Wolf, teeters on the fine line between condescending and corrupt, because it makes fun of Joe, who is a hapless trailer denizen, but also wants us to feel sorry for him. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",16958,1

"As the least likely filmmaker on the planet to pull off a G-rated miracle, David Lynch rises to the challenge with exhilarating vigor. It may not sound like much, but this account of an old man making a long trip on a riding lawn mower turns out to be a slow-moving, folksy-looking, deeply spiritual film with the power to hold audiences in thrall. It would not have been possible without Richard Farnsworth's terse, no-nonsense honesty at its heart. Mr. Lynch's famously unwholesome imagination crosses a new frontier to explore simple virtues and natural beauty. The result: a supremely improbable triumph. — Janet Maslin",16968,1
"This cynical dried-eyed comedy suggests a European echo of American cult movies like &quot;Scenes From the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills,&quot; in which sex is inextricably bound up with greed and social ambition.  For the movie's pampered middle-aged narrator Daniel (Fernando Guillen Cuervo), a lawyer in Madrid, affluence affords a license to be a fool for love. He and his gossipy gay friends like to prey on impoverished young Eastern European hunks swarming through the city in search of a better life. Daniel allows himself to become besotted with a 23-year-old Bulgarian stud (Dritan Biba) whom he recklessly aids and abets in drug trafficking and much worse. The weakness of one man's flesh augurs potentially catastrophic consequences. The movie is smart and well acted, with considerable heat. &#151; Stephen Holden",16969,1
"Julianne Moore and Pierce Brosnan, charming and appealing as ever, do their best to keep this attempt at light-hearted Manhattan romance afloat.

The two stars play dueling divorce lawyers who fall in and out of love with a remarkable lack of conviction. Frances Fisher, as Ms. Moore's youth-obsessed mother, is the only person in the movie with any moxie, which only serves to emphasize how timid and soft the whole affair is. — A. O. Scott",16970,1

Directed and written by Yoshiaki Kawajiri, the film is the second in a series of &quot;Vampire Hunter&quot; pictures based on a popular novel-size comic book written by Hideyuki Kikuchi and illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano. The protagonist, known simply as D, is powerfully reminiscent of the apparently amoral bounty hunter played by Clint Eastwood in the Leone films.  He is a determined loner and a forthright mercenary until at last his underlying nobility is revealed by a selfless gesture. - Dave Kehr",16981,1

With its impeccable timing, steady kinetic drive and superbly  choreographed chase sequences through the canals of Venice and the streets of Los  Angeles, it feels like a smooth, exciting whoosh down a ski slope. This particular  variation on the caper formula is a revenge drama in which a team of honorable thieves  led by Mark Wahlberg plots to steal back the stolen gold that was hijacked by a traitor (Edward Norton) after an earlier heist: insubstantial but well made for its type. — Stephen Holden",16984,1

"To describe the documentary film &quot;Bright Leaves&quot; as a study of the tobacco industry in the filmmaker's native state of North Carolina would be a little like calling a Virginia Woolf novel a manual of etiquette. Birth, death, illness, family and social history, childhood and old age, moviemaking, geography and commerce are among the topics Ross McElwee weaves into a dense but surprisingly orderly bundle of information, memory and conjecture.  The quest he undertakes in &quot;Bright Leaves&quot; is rooted in his own family background. His great-grandfather was a tobacco king who created the brand known as &quot;Bull Durham.&quot; As a photographer, he has a knack for studying a weather-beaten face and instantly discovering the soul inside. Whether he's recording a family gathering, contemplating the beauty of the coastline and his young son happily frolicking in the surf, or surveying a tobacco field, Mr. McElwee conveys a sensuous appreciation of life. Mr. McElwee, who has made seven feature-length documentaries, is really an American humorist in a tradition that extends from Mark Twain through Garrison Keillor. — Stephen Holden",17008,1

"The aerial sequences in Jan Sverak's sentimental but competent film are as gripping in their low-tech way as any of the aircraft scenes we're used to seeing in films. The World War II setting puts the audience in the middle of the dogfights. And there are complicated politics involved. The movie uses flashbacks to tell the story of Franta (Ondrej Vetchy), a Czech pilot interned in a labor camp after the Communist takeover. He is shown fleeing Czechoslovakia for England to fight the Nazis. The romantic story is less complicated, and far less interesting; Franta becomes involved in a triangle with his best friend, Karel (Krsytof Hadek), and Susan (Tara Fitzgerald), the woman Karel met first. It's too bad Mr. Sverak doesn't stick with the political aspect, which makes &quot;Dark Blue World&quot; smart and distinctive. – Elvis Mitchell",17010,1

"&quot;For da Love of Money,&quot; an independent feature written, directed by and starring the comedian who uses the single name Pierre, is a loose but often amusing collection of gags centered around a simple situation. There has been an armored-car robbery in Pierre's African-American neighborhood in Los Angeles, and one of the crooks, fleeing the scene, has dumped $20,000 in stolen money in a garbage can in Pierre's backyard.  Pierre — or Dre, as his character is named — suddenly finds himself the most popular man on the block as the half-true rumor that he has come into a lot of money begins to circulate. Pierre is a quietly funny, reactive comedian who relies less on the aggressive insult humor currently in fashion than on an artfully arched eyebrow and a disbelieving look directed at the absurd behavior he sees around him. — Dave Kehr",17012,1

"It will be impossible for you to walk past a shuttered restaurant and not feel a chill after seeing this documentary. The directors may not be great filmmakers &#151; it's hard to tell based on the bare bones picture they shot here &#151; but they know a great story, and more important, how to tell it. The movie will grip those fascinated by the restaurant business, and those who merely drift by the Food Network on the way to MoreMax or Speedvision on the cable dial. The directors demonstrate an eye for intriguing real-life drama. They get it from the film's subjects, John McCormick and Billy Phelps. The men are a pair of starry-eyed, eager would-be restaurateurs from Minnesota opening a new spot in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. As they discuss their thoughts for their slice-shaped eatery, they're like the young sisters in Jim Sheridan's &quot;In America,&quot; their eyes gleaming with joy over a first glimpse of  the Manhattan skyline. They plant their flag far from the madding crowd. &quot;I have no food experience, no restaurant experience,&quot; Mr. Phelps admits, and then adds, &quot;I don't know how many local customers we'll get there.&quot; The movie's subtle subtext is that restaurants are as big a reason for coming to New York as starting a band or writing a novel, only the dining path is far more treacherous. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",17033,1

The stories they tell about the Broadway stage in the 1940's, 50's and 60's, and about scuffling in New York City in less opulent times, could fill a book of Broadway theatrical lore. Some of the archival material is impressive: an excerpt from a live audio recording of Marlon Brando's stage performance in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;; grainy snippets of musicals filmed from orchestra seats; and a 1938 screen test of the actress Laurette Taylor, whom several of the talking heads exalt as the greatest theater actor they ever saw. — Stephen Holden",17048,1

"After the galloping intelligence displayed in the first two parts of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; series, your fear may be that Peter Jackson would become cautious and unimaginative with the last episode of his trilogy. But Mr. Jackson crushes any such fear. His &quot;King&quot; is a meticulous and prodigious vision made by a director who was not hamstrung by heavy use of computer special-effects imagery. The final installment  follows the hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood), increasingly fevered as the ring exercises its power over him, on the last leg of his perilous journey to Mordor to destroy the sinister object.  The wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), in a voice sodden with mellow sadness, believes that Frodo is on a suicide mission: &quot;There never was much hope. Just a false hope.&quot; Mr. Jackson takes his time with the story, but he's not sloughing off here. Rather he is building toward a more than solid conclusion. The grandiloquence that sustained the second installment, &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; with its pounding and operatic martial fury — a movie that actually created a state of siege and left audiences hanging —  can be found here. By its end, &quot;King&quot; glides to the gentle bonhomie that opened the &quot;Ring&quot; movies, but its epilogue is tinged with regret: &quot;You can't go back. Some wounds don't heal.&quot; It's an epic about the price of triumph, a subversive victory itself in a large-scale pop-action film. — Elvis Mitchell",17056,1
"This devastating anti-war film, set in the Balkans, is a dark comedy with a difference. Two wounded soldiers, one a Bosnian, the other a Serb, are trapped together in a trench (no man's land) between enemy lines. A third soldier (a Bosnian), presumed dead, regains consciousness, but cannot be moved because a deadly mine was slipped under his body. What to do? As the soldiers squabble like schoolyard children, United Nations rescue workers and a global television network, each with its own twisted agenda, become involved.

This often lawless territory, where the mortality rate among young black males runs high, has been visited before and to better effect, by filmmakers like Spike Lee and John Singleton. And while the impulse behind Mr. Watstein's film is commendable, the net effect carries less high drama and emotional impact than well-intended sermonizing. - Lawrence Van Gelder",17060,1

Julianne Moore, as the F.B.I. agent Clarice Starling, is game but almost superfluous: Hannibal himself is rendered in such operatic terms that you half expect Hopkins to burst into an Andrew Lloyd Webber song.

Owen Wilson gives his usual smart, lazy thing as a small time crook mixed up with some shady doings, and Morgan Freeman, as the mentor who may in fact be his nemesis, is as wry and mellow as ever. Sara Foster, a former magazine model, slips into the relaxed vibe and out of whatever flimsy beachwear she has on.

"This definitive, deeply engrossing film biography of the famously scrappy, hard-drinking poet Charles Bukowski, who died in 1994, combines interviews, many done for European 113 television, with the reminiscences of former drinking buddies, fellow writers, and his second wife Linda, the keeper of his flame. The portrait that emerges is of a cantankerous misanthrope zestfully living out his legend as a profane realist and professional lowlife, whose lean, brutal literary style allowed no sentimentality. He wryly credits his abusive childhood in which his father regularly beat him for no reason as helping form his style. Without straining, the film makes a strong case for Bukowski as a major American poet whose work was a slashing rebuke to polite academic formalism. — Stephen Holden",17102,1

"Firefighter Steve Marley and four of his colleagues talk with quiet strength about themselves and their job in this moving documentary film by Carol Ann Francis. Ms. Francis began interviewing members of the Fire Department   in the spring of 2001. Her goal, she explained, was to discover what motivated people &quot;to put another human life ahead of their own.&quot; The world changed on Sept. 11, but Ms. Francis kept to her task, ultimately recording groups of firefighters in 15 units around New York City. The finished film includes only these five men, from the firehouse on Webster Avenue in the Fordham section of the Bronx, all of whom spoke after Sept. 11. And even though the events of that day are never expressly mentioned, they hover dramatically around the subjects and the viewer. — Ron Wertheimer",17104,1

Everyone in the movie, which is based on a stage play by Dan Bucatinsky, who also  portrays one of the leading characters, is beset by the same neurotic insecurities, confused priorities and fears of commitment. And in the end, all it takes is a little opening up — the confession of a deep, dark secret or the simple avowal of vulnerability — to transform rocky relationships into storybook romances. - Dave Kehr",17117,1

This time, Mr. Pacino is Walter Burke, whose job is to recruit and train intelligence operatives. &quot;I have a scary eye for talent,&quot; he says. What Mr. Pacino displays is his peculiar, and often amusing, gift for ranting, spluttering and braying, and his wildly unpredictable, borderline-incoherent performance is the only interesting thing in the movie. Colin Farrell, as Burke's troubled protégé, James Clayton, an M.I.T. graduate student who seems to have misplaced his shaving kit in all the excitement, works very hard without producing anything like the casual, nutty intensity Mr. Pacino can summon so effortlessly.

"Only the French, those self-proclaimed sages of  &quot;l'amour fou,&quot; would dream of concocting a surreal romantic allegory like this grown-up fairy tale. The rococo fantasy, tricked out with animation and with actors sailing like little Supermen through toy cutout clouds, belongs to the same school of whimsical excess as  &quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot; and &quot;Amelie.&quot; But as the movie glides along, its story turns considerably darker than its fluffy, candy-colored forerunners. Narrated by its  protagonist (Guillaume Canet), the movie follows the increasingly destructive games of one-upmanship he plays over three decades with his closest childhood friend (Marion  Cotillard). The two meet as 8-year-old children and enter a private world in which  they dare each other to carry out increasingly outrageous pranks. On one level, the movie  is a parable of the battle of the sexes. On another it portrays the insanity of any romantic  quest (they love each other but can't say it) in which the postponement of fulfillment  becomes a desperate end in itself. &#151; Stephen Holden",17149,1

"The comedy &quot;13 Going on 30&quot; is essentially a retread of &quot;Big.&quot; What keeps the picture going is the director Gary Winick's love for actors, and his refusal to judge them by the characters they play. And any movie that telegraphs its fondness for its cast automatically has something going for it that's rare in contemporary comedy; this isn't one of those movies in which most of the actors steer clear of upstaging the star. This spiritual decency, a handful of songs from the toddler days of MTV and a few other fillips of clear-eyed charm go a long way toward making up for the tiredness of the concept, a kid magically leapfrogging into the body of an adult. In this case, it's 13-year-old Jenna (Christa B. Allen), who's suffering through a miserable failure of a birthday.  When some magic dust that a friend gives her lands on her carefully moussed hair, she awakens from a nap as a 30-year-old version of herself (Jennifer Garner). As acted by Ms. Garner, Jenna has a coltish gawkiness that she never quite sublimates. The obvious laughs are wrung from the contrast of an inexperienced child in a mature body, as Jenna bobs through a world in which the supposed adults turn out to be more childish than she is. The performances give the movie more flavor and life than the situation, which often feels like pre-chewed Bubble Yum. — Elvis Mitchell",17151,1

This actor's skills &#151; for precision and understatement, and for unexpectedly allowing a gleeful, almost crazed energy to burst out in otherwise somber circumstances &#151; are impressively evident, but the movie is so small and emotionally constricted that it gives him too little room to explore his range.

The director Brian Dannelly resists easy, smug caricature, but the picture ultimately fails both as comedy and as sentimental melodrama, veering from not-very-funny jokes to canned speeches about tolerance and human fallibility. This is a shame, since the bright young cast (especially Mandy Moore, relishing the chance to play a villainous, self-righteous teenage queen be) performs with conviction and high spirits. Jena Malone plays Mary, who becomes pregnant while trying to cure her gay boyfriend and whose crisis separates the pious hypocrites from the decent folk.

Justin Lin, the writer and director of this shrewdly tense piece of storytelling, recognizes that sometimes it's good for a filmmaker to stir up trouble. He does so by taking the group most often orphaned into stereotypical behavior by teen films, Asian-Americans. Ben (Parry Shen), a naive grind of an overachiever, is pulled into an orbit of friends and small-time criminals. First comes a lucrative cheating operation, a hustle that gives the boys way too much spare cash to go along with their extra free time. And the kids find that their brains and ambition work just as well racking up the kinds of activities that don't look good on a college application. Their homeroom-based guile finally leads Ben, who eventually wants to break free, into one last, potentially liberating crime. Ben, who has probably seen the same movies most of the audience has, knows things probably won't come to a good end, but he can't really walk away. — Elvis Mitchell",17264,1

He and his men end up trying to save a few dozen refugees from becoming victims of a ghastly genocidal campaign. The film's sentimentality is so overpowering, and so dumb, that it fails as drama, as action and as geopolitical fable. The filmmakers have gone to the trouble to invent a fictitious civil war in a real country, and for what? To soothe the American conscience about its failure to prevent actual recent slaughters? To give Mr. Willis another opportunity to exercise his talent for weary, manly stoicism? To give the egregious Hans Zimmer, who wrote the score, a chance to incorporate drums and pseudo-African choral effects? &#151; A. O. Scott",17267,1

"Tom Hanks, playing Dr. G. H. Dorr, a Mississippi classics professor whose true vocation is crime, seizes the chance to play a comic villain with almost indecent vaudevillian glee in this uneven, prankish caper comedy by Joel and Ethan Coen. His endless stream of nonsensical erudition is matched by Irma P. Hall's no-nonsense righteousness. With stereotype-smashing gusto, she plays Marva Munson, a pious African-American widow whose house Dorr uses as a staging ground for his heist of a riverboat casino. The heist plot is mighty tired, and the Coens don't really bother to revive it. Instead, they confect an uneven shaggy-dog joke, with a handful of pricelessly funny moments (some courtesy of J. K. Simmons and Marlon Wayans, as two of Dr. Dorr's criminal confederates) and a splendid and sublime gospel soundtrack. — A. O. Scott",17277,1

"This just-the-facts documentary buries its lead a bit. The film follows a group of women through their grueling schedules in the financial world. By the time it burrows more specifically into the lives of the four subjects &#151; the New York Stock Exchange floor broker Louise Jones, the equity research analyst Carol Warner Wilke, the foreign exchange sales trader Kimberley Euston and the Wharton School business student Umber Ahmad &#151; the movie is far more watchable. Perhaps it's understandable that the directors want to establish a context to the demands of Wall Street, an environment with an atmosphere as dense and troublesome as the gravity of Jupiter. The withering compromise comes from self-generated stress, especially given that discrimination isn't as overt as it used to be on Wall Street &#151; though the number of women is still small. The burdens the subjects place on themselves, in attempts to juggle personal and work existences, is brutal and more informative than the prologue tutorial. The flux in the subjects' lives, and the determination that put them in such rarified positions, is what gives &quot;Risk&quot; some needed roughage. Much of the film takes place in the summer; Ms. Warner Wilke's husband jokes that they sure are glad their children were born in July or August, when things are slower but, as we learn, not much slower. She's striving to be included in a magazine's upcoming ranking of financial figures. The directors catch Ms. Jones on her annual return to the Upper West Side location where she was abandoned as a 2-day-old. She's in the midst of selling her company to a larger firm and contemplating motherhood. The moderately arresting &quot;Risk&quot; at times appears to suffer from a lack of resources and seems to be writ small, suggesting that it may play better on television. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",17338,1

In the process of perfecting their dance act (to the thump of a wonderfully incongruous disco beat), these lovable lugs learn a thing or two about masculinity. Brightly acted and casually hilarious, the film exploits this gimmick in witty, trenchant ways that are always generous, never cruel. Peter Cattaneo's winning feature debut understands that joblessness is a humiliation well beyond nakedness, but it also revels in the sight of downtrodden ex-workers learning to enjoy their new freedom. This comedy is cheerfully raunchy but doesn't embarrass its cast with frontal nudity. Scrappy Robert Carlyle, also of ''Trainspotting,'' emerges as a star. — Janet Maslin",17359,1

Mr. Li's action sequences are like an oil fire, spilling from one room into the next and lighting the interiors with heat and wreckage.

His charge, Pita (Dakota Fanning, and shouldn't that be Tortilla?), gets him off the sauce and gives him a reason to live. Or,  rather, to kill, since once she is kidnapped he draws on all his old   professional skills to wage a one-man war against the kidnappers terrorizing   the city. &quot;Kill them all!&quot; hisses Pita's mother (Radha Mitchell), and that  pretty much sums it up. Tony Scott's annoying camera tricks and souped-up  effects — including English subtitles for English dialogue — are perhaps  meant to make the movie look better than it is. But they only make it  worse — the worst movie of the year so far. — A. O. Scott",17373,1
"Because the film is a convoluted meditation on  the guilt that often accompanies personal wealth, this wistful, self-effacing comedy is a  movie that will push your buttons. Is it possible to not to feel twinges of envy and scorn  for a character who worries obsessively about having no material worries? The director, Valeria Bruni Tedeschi, stars in her own movie as Federica, an attractive, aspiring playwright with a big horsey grin and a load of guilt to shoulder as she faces the prospect of inheriting a fortune when her terminally ill father dies. The film is the kind of exercise in semi-autobiographical reflection that is almost impossible to carry off without seeming self-absorbed. But then so was Federico Fellini's early 60's masterpiece, &quot;8 1/2,&quot; in which the world revolved surreally around a creatively blocked director. Ms. Tedeschi's comedy, by contrast, goes out of its way to puncture any aura of grandiosity. &#151; Stephen Holden",17374,1

The film, which is loosely inspired by a 1998 article by Paula Deitz in The New York Times about a gardening program in a prison in the Cotswolds, is as synthetic as a rubber rose, but it is all but indistinguishable from the organically grown, bred-in-Britain article. &#151; Dave Kehr",17388,1

"Clint Eastwood's film, scrupulously faithful to the letter and sprit of Dennis Lehane's novel, has the gritty efficiency of superior crime fiction and the somber weight of tragedy. Set in working-class Irish Catholic Boston, this film revisits the themes of violence, honor and guilt that have haunted many of Mr. Eastwood's movies; it is among the most humane of his films, but also the most rigorously pessimistic. Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn play Dave, Sean and Jimmy, boyhood friends who must revisit the traumas of their youth when Jimmy's daughter is murdered. Sean and his partner (Laurence Fishburne) must investigate the killing, which it appears Dave may have committed. The performances are first rate. Marcia Gay Harden, as Dave's wife, Celeste, and Laura Linney, as her cousin Annabeth, who is married to Jimmy, expand the film's emotional compass, allowing us to see how grief ripples through families and communities. Mr. Penn's volcanic, furiously disciplined performance is surely one of the best pieces of screen acting you'll see this year; it may even be one of the finest ever. — A. O. Scott",17395,1

There are practical reasons for this dilution of wit. When it was decided to spin off a feature-length animated film from the series, the decision was also made that the movie serve as a kind of prequel intended to introduce its squeaky-voiced little-girl superheroes to a wider audience unfamiliar with the series' in-jokes and mildly subversive humor. The gist of the movie is a raw fable about good and evil and self-empowerment, in which the girls have to earn their superhero status after two disastrous mistakes. — Stephen Holden",17399,1
"In this exhausting, incoherent thriller, Michael Douglas plays Nathan Conrad, a Manhattan psychiatrist whose young daughter is kidnapped by a sadistic band of jewel thieves.

Adding to the confusion is a tough, sexy homicide detective (Jennifer Esposito) whose investigation of a series of murders leads her to Dr. Conrad.

In examining the lives of a group of contemporary Canadian-Armenians who are making a movie about the catastrophe, it ponders the relation between historical and personal memory and art, and focuses on a canvas by the Armenian painter Arshile Gorky, who survived the massacre. If &quot;Ararat&quot; is the year's most thought-provoking film, its ingeniously convoluted structure tends to box in its characters. — Stephen Holden",17402,1

But so does a lot of sentimentality, and as the sentimentality quotient rises, it erodes the film's credibility. Many of the characters spend the movie baldly lying to one another.

Cut to a few years later, and the two are setting off individually to find the clues that will lead them to each other.  This movie is the cinematic equivalent of a plate made of spun sugar. The director Peter Chelsom's touch shines with a kind of craftsmanship, but it's sticky to the touch; if you look hard enough, you can see the sugar granules gleaming just beneath the surface. – Elvis Mitchell",17432,1

"An entertaining and effective expansion of the Disney Channel series to roughly the dimensions of a feature film.  Using a teen dream scenario that dates back at least to &quot;Three Coins in the Fountain&quot; (1954) and &quot;Rome Adventure&quot; (1962), Jim Fall (&quot;Trick&quot;) and his three writers follow Lizzie and her classmates on a summer trip to Rome, where romance and adventure quite naturally follow.   For all the film's antiseptic, sitcom qualities, it does touch on some significant moral and behavioral issues, just like the Disney serials most parents will remember (&quot;Spin and Marty,&quot; etc.), though tempered by the 21st-century notion that shopping is the best solution to any kind of psychological stress.   And Hilary Duff, as the gorgeous but fatally self-conscious Lizzie, is quite appealing. — Dave Kehr",17441,1

Ms. Reboux's extraordinary performance conveys Anaïs's mixture of precocious insight, animal canniness and vulnerability so powerfully that it ranks among the richest screen portrayals of a child ever filmed. And it provides a disturbing reminder that children's inner lives are as complicated (and their fantasies often as raw) as those of adults. &quot;Fat Girl&quot; is the most powerful dispatch yet from Ms. Breillat, France's most impassioned correspondent covering the war between the sexes. — Stephen Holden",17446,1

During a chase in a remote mountainous region of Japan, Samehada's getaway car strikes the SUV piloted by the Peach Hip Girl, Toshiko (Sie Kohinata), prompting Samehada to commandeer Toshiko and her car to continue his escape.

With &quot;Presumed Guilty,&quot; a documentary produced by the San Francisco public television station KQED and directed by Pamela Yates, the process comes full circle. Following half a dozen public defenders and their clients through the San Francisco court system, &quot;Presumed Guilty&quot; makes compelling viewing.

What if those monsters that you thought were hiding under the bed or in the recesses of your closet were real, and what if once you were safely grown up they came back for you? These are the questions that Julia (Laura Regan), a high-strung graduate student in psychology, must face at an especially inconvenient time. As she prepares to defend her thesis, the city she lives in is menaced by rolling power shortages, spooky music (by Elia Cmiral) and incessant rain, and her childhood friend Billy (John Abrahams) shows up raving about the scary creatures that are pursuing him. — A.O.

"This film finds Andrei Konchalovsky dredging up one of the most depleted metaphors from the bottom of the cinematic sea:  the madhouse as microcosm.  Mr. Konchalovsky's mental institution is a rundown 19th-century mansion located somewhere near the border of the breakaway republic of Chechnya, and is filled with a mix of archetypes from both the Russian and the Muslim world &#151; an elderly seer who may be Allah, a plump babushka who pines for the Communist government, and so on, up to and including the inevitable dwarf.   As in Philippe de Broca's &quot;King of Hearts&quot; (1966), which &quot;House of Fools&quot; resembles to a highly painful degree, the viewer is given to understand that the gentle, childlike inmates are far saner than the generals and politicians who run the big, brutal outside world.   This dubious, sentimental proposition is immediately undermined by Mr. Konchalovsky's decision to include among his extras several individuals with genuine disfiguring illnesses.  You wonder how lucky they feel to be among the elect. &#151; Dave Kehr",17576,1

The picture is full of snappy jokes, and two uninhibited comic performances, by Rhys Ifans and Miranda Otto. But the director, Michel Gondry, seems unable to find the right comic rhythm, and Patricia Arquette and Tim Robbins, as a fur-covered nature writer and a priggish behavioral scientist who discover a feral ape man in the woods outside New York, seem as tentative and self-conscious as guest hosts stuck in a long &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch.

This intensely sharp-witted remake of a 1997 Norwegian film also stars Robin Williams as the subject of the detective's chase, a canny murderer with no one to brag to, except Will.

"Written and directed by Raj Nidimoru and Krishna DK, this independent feature &#151; a product of the Indian Diaspora &#151; was shot and takes place largely in New Jersey, where the thoroughly Americanized Rad (Anupam Mittal) is about to be married to his tall, blonde American fiancée (Jicky Schnee).  Arriving from the old country for the big event, Rad's tradition-minded parents are at first appalled by such American customs as allowing women to smoke on the street, but before too long are happily adapting American folkways, like wearing promotional T-shirts and going for aimless walks along empty suburban streets. The picture is bright, good-spirited and, for Bollywood, blissfully short at a mere 114 minutes, but fans will be disappointed by the lack of the wonderfully demented musical numbers that are the Hindi cinema's defining characteristic. &#151; Dave Kehr",17588,1

"The stoic mysticism of Niki Caro's cool-handed, New Zealand-set charmer, in which Pai, a young Maori, has to overcome resistance to her assuming her familial destiny as the leader of her tribe, is wickedly absorbing. Much of its power comes from the delicate charisma of Keisha Castle-Hughes, making her acting debut as Pai. Her instinctive underplaying gives the film an added gravity, with the lush remoteness serving as an entrancing contrast to the sugar-rush, you-go-girl empowerment of programmed pandering like &quot;The Lizzie McGuire Movie.&quot; Each shot of the vistas in the breathtakingly lovely village where &quot;The Whale Rider&quot; takes place is presented with an even clarity, with the director and her cinematographer, Leon Narbey, leaving it to viewers to be seduced by its daunting power rather than overwhelming them with it. — Elvis Mitchell",17590,1

"Wes Anderson, the director of &quot;Rushmore,&quot; has made a movie that the precocious adolescent hero of that film might have made: show-offy, self-impressed, but with sparks of undeniable insight and ingenuity. Set in a New York dreamworld confected out of children's books and antique New Yorker fiction, &quot;Tenenbaums&quot; purports to explore the lives of a family of child geniuses, some of their friends and their estranged parents. With a few exceptions, the cast does an admirable job of finding what life there is in Mr. Anderson's static, literary creatures, but it is impossible to believe that these people have much to do with one another, or with anything outside their creator's hothouse imagination. The Tenenbaums are less a family than a collection of dolls fussed over by a compulsive collector. The only actor who succeeds in breaking through the suffocating whimsy is Gene Hackman as Royal, the clan's wildly irresponsible patriarch. – A. O. Scott",17656,1

It was the music, after all that lent emotional weight and historical resonance to the Coens' exuberantly silly pastiche of Southern folklore, Preston Sturges and Homer's &quot;Odyssey.&quot; And here the voices of Ralph Stanley, Alison Krauss, Chris Thomas King and a few dozen other keepers of the old-time flame are presented in their unadorned and timeless glory. &#151; A.

"A stark moral fable told in the language of the sort of western that Hollywood has stopped making, &quot;The Tracker&quot; which is set in 1922 in the Australian outback, could be viewed as a companion piece to &quot;Rabbit-Proof Fence,&quot; which takes place nine years later. The story follows three mounted policemen and an Aboriginal tracker on a mission to bring to justice a black man accused of murdering a white woman. The characters have symbolic names like the Tracker, the Fanatic, the Follower, the Veteran and the Fugitive. Gary Sweet's Fanatic is as scary a racist fiend as has ever been brought to the screen. David Gulpilil's Tracker, who is a bridge between the Aboriginal and white societies, exudes the same aura of mystical watchfulness and omniscience that he brought to the movies &quot;Walkabout,&quot; &quot;The Last Wave&quot; and &quot;Rabbit-Proof Fence.'' The story is strung around a 10-song suite of narrative ballads, and  handsome mural-like illustrations by Peter Coad that deepen its mythical flavor. — Stephen Holden",17697,1

"Losing millions of dollars doesn't seem like much of a turn-on for Dan Mahowny (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the obsessive gambler and protagonist of &quot;Owning Mahowny&quot; — though his losses are slightly less, considering that he's gambling with Canadian money. And in Richard Kwietniowski's film of this true-life story, the only rush for us comes in the accretion of details as to how Dan defrauds the Toronto bank, where he's the youngest manager in history, of millions of dollars. And even that's not much of thrill: he just signs for the dough and no one checks up on him. Dan is so anhedonic as to make Alvy Singer, the misery-loving Woody Allen archetype of &quot;Annie Hall,&quot; seem like Snoop Dogg. As notable as Mr. Hoffman's burrowing into the insides of Mahowny is, the steadfast denial is so complete — and Dan is closed off even from himself — that we can only observe him from the outside.  Whatever minor entertainment there is to be gleaned from &quot;Mahowny,&quot; set in the early 80's and based mostly in Toronto, comes in bits and pieces — like Maury Chaykin's temperamental, egocentric Frank, the bookie who keeps running Dan's bets. &quot;Mahowny&quot; is closer in some ways to &quot;Auto Focus,&quot; Paul Schrader's film about the sexaholic Bob Crane. That movie also played out a story of dysfunctional fixation, and the pursuit of a lifestyle as an exercise in futility. In certain cases, like &quot;Mahowny,&quot; the normally desirable virtues of modesty and detachment work against the picture to make it feel like an exercise in futility. — Elvis Mitchell",17708,1

Cobbling together ancient cross-cultural myths of initiation and human beings who turn into animals, it  tells the story of Kenai (the voice of Joaquin Phoenix), a hot-headed Indian boy on the verge of  manhood who is transformed into a bear so he can learn compassion for all creatures  great and small.

Jessica Lange is Tamora, the captured Goth empress who strikes back. Although the movie's British theatrical and American film acting styles don't mesh, Ms. Taymor's vision is realized with a shattering force in time-traveling imagery that blends ancient Rome with Mussolini's Italy and contemporary cyberpunk flash. &#151; Stephen Holden",17762,1

"Lars Von Trier, notorious tormentor of innocent, defenseless women, picks on someone his own size this time, a fellow Danish filmmaker named Jorgen Leth. In the 1960's, Mr. Leth made a 12-minute film called &quot;The Perfect Human,&quot; which Mr. von Trier claims to have seen 20 times and which he assigns his elder colleague to remake. The five new versions are made under increasingly exigent and absurd constraints — one is a cartoon, one must be shot in the worst place on earth and one must contain no shot lasting more than half a second — and the results are fascinating and strange. The heart of &quot;The Five Obstructions,&quot; though, is the psychological drama that develops as the mercurial Mr. von Trier faces off against the cool, implacable Mr. Leth. This examination of the arbitrariness and irrationality at the heart of the creative progress makes you wonder why anyone in his right mind would make a movie, and also grateful that oddballs like Mr. von Trier and Mr. Leth, against all reason, bother to do so. — A.

"Peter Jackson's scrupulous devotion to the spirit of J.R.R. Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy manifests itself in a gripping, intense fashion in this second of the film adaptations. It may be the first sequel that does not bother to give a reprise of the major plot elements of its predecessor immediately; the plan is simply to drop us right into the action. This stratagem creates a few moments of apprehension, the same disconcerted quality that the hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are experiencing on their journey. Their mission began in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; when Frodo was entrusted with the ring that gives its bearer enormous powers and, incidentally, could begin the end of life on Middle Earth. The warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) has been inflated into an even more assured, reflexive action hero. He helps a bewitched king (Bernard Hill) defend his castle. The action sequences are even more compelling than the first time around; we could be watching Orson Welles's &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot; as directed by George A. Romero — Shakespearean-scale bloodshed and loss as an exploitation movie. There are flaws, particularly the family-oriented video-game aspects, which offer no emotional complications other than saving the day. — Elvis Mitchell",17787,1

"This witty but sensual fusion of silent film and ballet is a collaboration by Guy Maddin,  a Canadian experimental director, and the Royal Winnipeg Ballet performing a work, choreographed by Mark Godden, that had its  stage premiere in 1998.  The director has accentuated the ballet's racial and erotic  subtexts with a cartoonish audacity, portraying the count as a mysterious Eastern Other  spreading contamination into the West. As Zhang Wei-Qiang's suave, swashbuckling Dracula  seduces and poisons his victims, you think of Attila the Hun as a Valentino-like  voluptuary.

"An elegant, elliptical meditation on death, sex, meat and desire. There is violence, and a subdued erotic throb, but the movie's pleasures are more cerebral than sensual. A group of far-flung, mostly lonely Europeans, including an actress (Chiara Mastrantonio), a taxidermist (Bernard Sens), a research scientist (Jacques Gamblin) and a five-year old girl with epilepsy (Raphaelle Molinier) are linked together by chance and coincidence. Specifically, they each come into contact with parts of a Spanish bull, who has gored a young matador and subsequently been slaughtered. The animal, whose name is Romero, produces not only meat, but metaphor as well; his death opens up a philosophical inquiry that is ambitious and sometimes rather vague. What makes &quot;Carnage&quot; fascinating, though, is less the scale of Delphine Gleize's intellectual passions than the precision and originality of her cinematic style. This movie, her first feature, is both lyrical and tough-minded, and her ability to embed ideas in visual compositions is as subtle as it is extraordinary. — A. O. Scott",17838,1

There are interesting ideas at work here about love, loss, and sexuality, but the emotional subtleties of the novel turn into bland speechifying. — A. O. Scott",17839,1

The director, Walt Becker, doesn't bring much to the table other than a sense of high spirits — a necessary but not sufficient condition for comedy.

Worth seeing just for its Forest Spirit, which takes animal form by day and roams the night as a diaphanous, Godzilla-like divinity.

In its freewheeling mixture of  romantic comedy and song and dance, the movie, which follows the bed-hopping  escapades of two couples, is stylistically closer to Bollywood than to Hollywood. A 21st  century version of a traditional sex farce, it tampers with the format by refusing tie up its  frayed loose ends in neat little bows. The satire is especially devastating to the men who  fancy themselves liberated but who become insecure, possessive little boys if they have  the slightest suspicion that a girlfriend they've betraying might be turning the tables. — Stephen Holden",17924,1

"This beguilingly entertaining absurdist comedy played the Cannes Film Festival, and scenes from the picture still float in my head. The writer-director Roy Andersson uses the wide screen to compose chillingly beautiful shots and locks the camera in place as the often humorous action unfolds. The movie eschews conventional narrative, choosing to build, in discrete episodes, on the horrifyingly hilarious revelation that Fate rolls into everyone. The slightly off-putting stillness and the unmoving frame give the comic tableaus the force of art, which reinforces the humor: it's a combination of Bergman and Feydeau. Or for those of us with pop sensibilities, Jacques Tati as rendered by &quot;The Far Side&quot; cartoonist, Gary Larson. &quot;Songs From the Second Floor,&quot; an example of an unsung genre, is a heartbreakingly thoughtful minor classic, the work of a genuine and singular artist. — Elvis Mitchell",17957,1

Filled with memorable tableaus, the movie is a  serious picture show whose cinematography by Conrad L. Hall lends every frame an  Edward Hopper-like mood. Mr. Newman (with an Irish brogue) steals the movie as  Rooney, the mob boss faced with agonizing life-and-death choices. Mr. Hanks holds his  own as the movie's enigmatic antihero on a vengeful mission: a killer-for-hire  with a social conscience and a devotion to his young son. — Stephen Holden",17963,1

Vivid and visually stunning, &quot;Bugs!&quot; is fun in the same self-satisfied and awe-struck way that most Imax movies are, seeming to be a cross between an infomercial and an Animal Planet documentary.  Judi Dench intones the narration with distracted urgency &#151; she sometimes sounds as if she's reading the script while working out a difficult crossword puzzle clue.

"An Afghan-American artist who barely remembers his roots (Baktash Zaher-Khadem) romances an Afghan-American woman (Mariam Weiss) who feels smothered by her tradition-minded family in Queens.

Shot on video, it's very much an amateur movie both in the sense of having been made under less than professional conditions (it seems to have been shot with a home video camera) and having been made out of love, rather than any profit motive. Wassel was not a natural-born filmmaker, but he did have a story to tell. &#151; Dave Kehr",18040,1

One soggy day, she spots Naoya (Kazuya Takahashi) and decides he should be the father after he gives her his umbrella. &quot;Hush!&quot; is a rambling, occasionally very funny reflection on the meaning of family in contemporary Japan. But the movie is so digressive that it often seems to be wandering off the path of a story that never reaches a firm conclusion. — Stephen Holden",18051,1

"All good filmmakers have a sense of film history; for the Canadian director Guy Maddin it's a history that cuts to the marrow. The filmmaker's obvious inspirations are culled from silent cinema and those first few years when movies learned to talk, but he evinces an appreciation for proto-cinematic forms as well. (He doesn't just delight in early movies, when women possessed rosebud mouths and men had manners as slick as pomade, he exudes in the splotches, accidental jump cuts and ragged edges that can cling to well-used movies.) Mr. Maddin's interest in the atavistic takes wonderful shape in his latest offering, a love story that was originally designed as an installation art piece in which 10 different chapters were viewed through separate peepholes. Since its conception, the film has been stitched into a near-feature-length movie and no longer will viewers need risk eyestrain and cramped necks to appreciate Mr. Maddin's singular genius. Raincoats, however, remain optional. &#151; Manohla Dargis",18053,1

Perhaps the lack of nourishment comes from the movie's pale recycling of &quot;Eat Drink Man Woman,&quot; Ang Lee's domestic food fight of a movie. &quot;Tortilla Soup&quot; has more warm, likable actors and agile performances than the material merits, and, at the very least, is this year's leading candidate for foodie classic, the type of picture that sends audiences scurrying for a meal after the credits roll. - Elvis Mitchell",18058,1

"With his compulsively slamming lyrics and king-of-the-world delivery, DMX intuitively echoed the projects-existentialism of the novelist Donald Goines for years. He's the perfect actor for the film adaptation of Goines's &quot;Never Die Alone,&quot; directed with street-corner majesty by the cinematographer-turned-director Ernest Dickerson. DMX stars as the drug dealer King David, who pops up in the streets again after a long absence. Rolling into the frame in a player's classic — a late 70's Stutz Blackhawk — King David shrugs his way back into the hard-knock life. He quickly reaps what he sows and, mortally wounded, passes all his worldly goods to Paul (David Arquette), a scrambling white would-be writer. King David's estate includes an audio journal of his life, which provides flashbacks and a narrative-within-a-narrative that answers the shaken Paul's curiosity. It's the highlights of King David's high life that propel &quot;Alone.&quot; Like all of Goines's heroes, King David is a scourge on the periphery, and the movie dramatizes his corrosive effect on the margins with savvy muscularity. Every life he touches he leaves in ruins — a need to deface beauty as a result of self-loathing is implicit, and DMX signals that motivation with sly hostility. To say that King David is the best part he's ever had is an understatement; he has never felt the need to inhabit a movie in this way before. — Elvis Mitchell",18071,1

Both blunt in its social observations (unmarried woman have a hard time of it in Muslim society) and enigmatic in its plotting (does the girl who feels attracted to Aman realize she is a woman or not?), the film is staged as a series of nearly motionless tableaus that force the viewer to share Aman's sense of imprisonment. &#151; Dave Kehr",18113,1

"Claude Chabrol has been dissecting the middle-class with his cold-blooded handiness for so long, he could do it in his sleep. With this newest tale of family and sexual complication bloodied by murder, you may feel like he's doing it in our sleep — or at least causing it. The movie starts with a grim tableau that has the suffocating potent accomplishment of classic Chabrol. The camera moves through a large, warm home peering into rooms, passing a young woman curled up on the floor in a ball of guilt before coming to rest on a sprawled corpse, blood pooled under its head.  The movie slips back to the familial difficulties involving François (Benoît Magimel) and the odd bond he has with his luminously beautiful stepsister Michèle (Mélanie Doutey) who's returning home to France after having lived in Chicago for a few years. Meanwhile, François's stepmother's campaign for mayor is reaching a crucial point; his piggish father's tolerance for her career has died out years ago. Minimal and inexorable, &quot;Flower&quot; wanders rather than moving chillingly toward its climax. The movie gets by on a few deadpan satirical brushes on politics and the performance by Suzanne Flon as Tante Line. Tante Line, who is eventually revealed to be the heartsick conscience of her family that is holding it together, comes from an actress working at the peak of her gifts. Ms. Flon almost achieves for the movie what her character does for her relatives  — she's just not enough. — Elvis Mitchell",18122,1

"David Mamet tries his hand at one of the oldest tricks in the book: a last-big-score caper about an aging thief (Gene Hackman) who masterminds a complex robbery while fending off a young, cocky rival (Sam Rockwell). Fans of Mr. Mamet's hard-boiled poetry will feast on the gamy dialogue, but the heart of the picture lies in the performances of Mr. Hackman and Delroy Lindo (as Mr. Hackman's trusted partner), who quietly turn it from a twisty crime film into an exploration of friendship, loyalty and professionalism. – A.

Anthony and Joe Russo, brothers from Cleveland, where the movie takes place, write and direct with a sloppy exuberance that is sometimes hard to distinguish from incompetence, but the cast members, happily slumming, mugging and making fools of themselves, toss off some gratifyingly silly slapstick moments. The caper plot, involving a crew of very small-time crooks, is pretty much abandoned in favor of jokey anarchy, as the actors, William H. Macy and Michael Jeter, in particular, try to steal the movie, which isn't worth much, but is sometimes fun all the same. — A. O. Scott",18127,1

"A strange, disturbing and yet occasionally quite funny cultural artifact from the new Russia, &quot;The Outskirts&quot; begins as a droll parody of a Soviet-era &quot;boy-meets-tractor&quot; movie and develops into a violent vigilante fantasy.  Released in Russia in 1998, its story line &#151; a group of hearty peasant types from the Urals track down the corrupt officials who sold their former collective farm to an oil oligarch &#151;  reportedly proved to be so incendiary that there were calls for the film to be banned.   Shooting in a stark black-and-white meant to evoke the socialist realist filmmaking of the 1930's, Pyotr Lutski is making a nostalgic appeal to an era that does not seem entirely worthy of such romantic reconsideration.  But at the same time, he has built so much postmodern irony into his film that it's hard to know where satire stops and sincerity begins.  Is Mr. Lutski endorsing his protagonists' brutal tactics or is he making fun of them?  Are they admirable role models from Russia's lost past or are they idiot thugs still employing the tactics of Stalin's secret police?  Ultimately these questions are unanswerable, which makes &quot;The Outskirts&quot; both a challenging film and a frustrating one. &#151; Dave Kehr",18137,1

"This is yet another professionally acted and staged wry-crisp comedy about British modesty — this one could be called &quot;How Full Was My Monty&quot; — that gets its laughs, but seems increasingly out of date. Chris (Helen Mirren) and Annie (Julie Walters) are middle-aged members of the Knapely chapter of the Women's Institute, an organization dedicated to promoting the ideals of &quot;fun and friendship.&quot; Chris, spotting a girlie calendar at her auto mechanic's garage, is inspired with the notion of posing nude for a calendar to raise money for charity. She finds a surprisingly large number of middle-aged to elderly recruits at the Institute. Ms. Mirren and Ms. Walters are a sunny, amusing couple, even when there's tension between them because Chris has so immersed herself in her new project that she's ignoring her son and  husband. The most likable aspect of the film is the husbands left on the sidelines, and the team behind &quot;Calendar Girls&quot; is savvy enough not to overplay that role reversal. But when the biggest compliment you can give a picture is that it's professional and not smug, there's a little some thing missing — like invention. — Elvis Mitchell",18164,1

"A cat-and-mouse thriller with delusions of grandeur, &quot;The  Statement&quot; arrives wrapped in an intimidating mystique of high-minded solemnity that  makes its vagueness and incoherence all the more disappointing.  Adapted by Ronald  Harwood (the screenwriter for &quot;The Pianist&quot;) from Brian Moore's best-selling novel, it  has a blue-ribbon cast. But as much as the actors invest their performances with  psychological nuance, their efforts go mostly for naught in a movie that gives character  development a distant back seat to the grinding mechanics of its manhunt plot. The main character, Brossard (Michael Caine in an emotionally chafing performance), is based on the real-life Paul Touvier, an officer in the French militia and a collaborator with the Vichy  government during World War II, who ordered the execution of seven Jewish hostages in 1944. Sheltered by right-wing Catholic priests, he was finally convicted of crimes against  humanity in 1989. The movie is a fictionalized story of the race to bring him to justice. — Stephen Holden",18188,1

Maggie Gyllenhaal is Lee, a repressed, masochistically inclined  young secretary who blooms under the spanking hand of her boss, Mr. Grey (James Spader), a tight-lipped lawyer who becomes her Pygmalion-like disciplinarian. Ms. Gyllenhaal imbues her Renee Zellweger-style role with a sly comic delicacy and  sweetness that should make her a star, while Mr. Spader is ideally cast as her fish-eyed  yuppie liberator. The movie is written and directed in a loopy, slightly surreal style that  blurs the line between fantasy and reality to illustrate its point that when it comes to  sexual excitement, one's fantasy is one's reality. — Stephen Holden",18216,1

"This documentary tells the story of the Weathermen, a splinter group from Students for a Democratic Society. This terrifically smart and solid piece of filmmaking lets the former members of the Weathermen, now on the downside of their 50's, speak into the camera and reveal a bit of their personal histories as well as what the peace movement mean to them. The documentary is also packed with some of the most powerful images of violence of the period, like a bound Vietnamese being shot in the head at point-blank range and the bloody bed of the Black Panther Fred Hampton after he was killed. Voluble and charismatic, the film's stars  — the members of the group determined to overthrow what they considered to be a criminal United States government that waged the Vietnam War and targeted groups like the Black Panthers — spent a lot of time in the media spotlight; young, white and articulate, figures like Bernadette Dohrn, Bill Ayers, Mark Rudd, Brian Flanagan and Naomi Jaffe were clearly very sexy criminals. That exuberance and incentive has been captured by the directors. Sam Green and Bill Siegel have made a film of passions, and they establish a context that shows what a turbulent period the late 1960's were, slyly contrasting the peace-and-love vibe with events of the time. The film doesn't let its subjects off the hook, despite apparent sympathies towards their politics. — Elvis Mitchell",18219,1

"All the characters in this gloomy  two-hour mosaic of everyday people whose lives are affected by the death of a young  Austrian woman in a car collision are searching for an underlying meaning to seemingly  random events. The sudden death of Manu (Kathrin Resetarits), a grocery store clerk on  the way home from a disco, comes six years after she narrowly survives a plane crash  while flying home from a vacation in Rio de Janeiro.  The movie toys with the possibility that Manu was living on borrowed time because  she had already cheated fate once. It also hints at the notion that Manu, even after her  death, might still be observing (and perhaps manipulating) the lives of her friends and  family in the dreary Austrian town where she grew up. The director Barbara Albert looks down on the characters in her overpopulated movie as though  she were an omniscient, cold-hearted ghost. In having most of them place their hopes in  tawdry games of chance and debased spiritualism, her pity for them is confused with her  contempt for the pop culture that preys on them. Although &quot;Free Radicals&quot; overflows  with messy feelings, it maintains such a measured distance from the assembled cries and  whispers that it's difficult to empathize with anyone. — Stephen Holden",18221,1

"Greg Pak's fantasy anthology piece, which details the ways robots have complicated the lives of humans, has a dexterous sense of wonder that nonetheless leaves the film feeling a bit detached. Perhaps it's because the stories themselves, well told, have the gentle lull of whimsy. But Mr. Pak's fascination with the material goes a long way — many of the loveliest touches seem to be inspired by Isaac Asimov's sweeping &quot;Robot Chronicles.&quot; The picture's ambition in fashioning intrigues also reveals the director's generosity of spirit. This quality is discernible in &quot;Machine Love,&quot; in which Mr. Pak can be seen as Archie, an android office worker who gamely endures the ridicule of the other drones around him because of his single-mindedness.  &quot;Machine Love&quot; could've been the title of the four pieces that make up &quot;Stories.&quot; In &quot;My Robot Baby,&quot; it's the intensity of a would-be mother (Tamlyn Tomita) desperate to pick up parenting skills to qualify for adoption that's easily the most compelling element in the vignettes. Mr. Pak's feel for melodrama adds a piercing and thoughtful end note similar to the emotional gravity found in Stephen King novellas like &quot;The Body&quot; and &quot;Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,&quot; both in Mr. King's collection &quot;Different Seasons.&quot; But it's Mr. Pak's respect for the actors that he's selected that seems to work hand-in-exoskeleton with the thematic mission of the protagonists in each chapter of &quot;Stories.&quot; It's this quality that links the film's segments closely to &quot;Different Seasons.&quot; The most startling aspect of &quot;Robot Stories&quot; is not the mix the filmmaker built from spare parts left on the curb, but Mr. Pak's evolving dramatic acumen. He's a talent with a future. — Elvis Mitchell",18233,1

The younger Mr. Brown was the co-writer and an associate producer on &quot;The Endless Summer II,&quot; a sequel released in 1994; with &quot;Step Into Liquid,&quot; he assumes the entire process, which includes writing, edited and delivering the casual, conversational narration that the senior Mr. Brown made a trademark of his films.  With its astounding views of angry seascapes, its handsome young men (and a few women) poised atop 10-foot waves with the serenity and aplomb of an equestrian statue in Central Park, nonstop soundtrack of old and new surfing songs (Richard Gibbs contributed an original score as well) and a pervasive philosophy that views life as fun and self-fulfillment as the highest good, what is there not to like? — Dave Kehr",18257,1

Everyone is looking for something other than what he or she has. That lusty self-interest is the motor of all great farces.

The agent of his transformation is Tommy (Steve Braun), an activist who gently coaxes Alan out of his closet.  By the time the film reaches its climax in 1983, with the outbreak of the AIDS epidemic, it has acquired far too many implausible plot twists and half-baked characterizations to stay in the memory for anything more than its decency and sincerity. &#151; Dave Kehr",18279,1

"Campbell Scott's &quot;Final&quot; is not an easy movie to characterize, and it is difficult to discuss without giving away the surprise that pops up halfway through, just when you thought you had figured out what was going on. Until that point, the movie is a vaguely Pinteresque dialogue between a psychiatrist (Hope Davis) and her moody, delusional patient (Denis Leary), interrupted by flashbacks of the patient's earlier life. But then, just as the splinters of his shattered personality begin to yield a coherent picture of who he was, the boundary between delusion and reality shifts, and the movie ventures from the familiar terrain of doctor-patient psychodrama into hazy sci-fi allegory and ethical problem play. – A.

The film offers no simple solutions to a complex situation, nor should it. The answers are in the eyes of the battered Afghani people, and with their cloud of fear and uncertainty — and brutality, too, in some cases — they are not at all easy to read. — Dave Kehr",18354,1

"Since a corporation is legally defined as a person, it makes sense to ask what kind of a person it is. In answer, this intelligent, hectoring documentary offers an elaborate psychopathology of dishonest, unscrupulous and predatory behaviors, which are seen as expressions of the corporation's fundamental nature. Case studies in environmental pollution, aggressive branding, the exploitation of workers and the abuse of technology alternate with more general disquisitions on the brutal logic of global capitalism. The talking heads are mainly activists and scholars — Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein and Michael Moore, among others — with a few C.E.O.'s and orthodox economists thrown in for balance. While much of the material is persuasive, the film ensnares itself in contradictions it does not acknowledge, and paints a grim, tendentious picture of the modern world. Even Marx recognized the creative, liberating force of capitalism, and without some acknowledgement of the comforts, conveniences and pleasures that corporations provide, it is hard to understand their power or, for that matter, to oppose it effectively. — A.

The movie shamelessly takes the neuroses of Annie Hall and her tormented beau, Alvy Singer, melts them down and pours the secondhand brew into the troubled Jessica Stein (Jennifer Westfeldt). Jessica wants to be involved in a relationship, and she scours the personal ads for the right person. It just so happens that someone is Helen (Heather  Juergensen), a downtown art gallery worker who's voracious for sex and a good time. The picture makes something of itself in its last third, when complications arise and Jessica gets another dimension.  But by then, it has tread so carefully to hit the footprints that Woody Allen has left before it that you might not care. – Elvis Mitchell",18380,1

Meanwhile, the dentist Oz Oseranky (Matthew Perry) spends his time trying  the patience of his wife, Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge). Oz needs Jimmy to help recover Cynthia, whom a mobster has kidnapped to bring Jimmy out of hiding; she's Jimmy's ex. The plotting of the second &quot;Yards&quot; isn't lazy, and there's one reasonably well-thought-out twist by the screenwriter George Gallo.

"So few movies demonstrate any interest in serious poetry that when the rare one comes along flashing a silver tongue and a fine-tipped quill, you're tempted to give it half a cheer simply for daring to exist.

Alfred Prufrock.&quot; The movie bases much of its imagery on the mellifluous last three lines of &quot;Prufrock&quot;: &quot;We have lingered in the chambers of the sea/By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown/Till human voices wake us, and we drown.&quot; Did I mention that the catalytic event in is a drowning? Before the movie is over, several rivers' worth of suds have gurgled down its overtaxed drain.

"Another maddening, fascinating mess from James Toback, one of the most undisciplined American filmmakers, and also one of the most intelligent. Sarah Michelle Gellar, taking a break from vampire slaying, plays a cynical, sexually confident cheerleader whose father is a powerful mobster. Her boyfriend (Adrian Grenier), the title character, plays point-guard for the Crimson and dabbles in existential philosophy, student-teacher sex and LSD. These interests involve him in all kinds of trouble, and he ends up spinning through Cambridge in a hallucinogen-induced frenzy, pursued by wannabe-wiseguys, kinky F.B.I. agents and the comedian Al Franken. Coherence and plausibility are beside the point; the movie has an antic, feckless vivacity, and even its silliest moments hum with intellectual energy and artistic daring. — A. O. Scott",18412,1

Narrative is not the motivating factor in this story of a couple (Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung) married to other people who find that their spouses are cheating on them. Instead, it's the filmmaker's heart that spills onto the screen, and this breathtakingly gorgeous movie is dizzy with a nose-against-the-glass romantic spirit that has been missing from the cinema for years. — Elvis Mitchell",18417,1

"The greatest mystery in this laborious, nonsensical thriller is why Philip Kaufman, whose credits include movies like &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; and &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being,&quot; bothered to lend his talents to such mediocre studio hackwork. Ashley Judd, struggling mightily to convince the world that she has a dark, complicated side, plays Jessica Shepard, a San Francisco homicide investigator who also seems to be the prime suspect in her first big case. The victims of an apparent serial killer all turn out to be men she has slept with, and the fact that Jessica's father was both a cop and a murderer makes the possibility of her guilt all the more plausible. Is she the killer, or is one of her friends and protectors — her mentor (Samuel L. Jackson), her partner (Andy Garcia), her shrink (David Strathairn), her ex-boyfriend (Mark Pellegrino) — setting her up? It is hard even to be curious, much less to care. — A. O. Scott",18419,1

"David Cronenberg's bleak minimalist film, adapted from Patrick McGrath's novel (with a screenplay by the author), crawls into the  mind of Dennis Cleg (Ralph Fiennes), a paranoid-schizophrenic man in his 30's who is discharged from a mental hospital into a grim halfway house near where he grew up in  East London. The desolate urban environment mirrors the mental condition of a man  whose warped memories of a homicide two decades earlier come flooding back as he  revisits childhood landmarks. Mr. Fiennes's mumbling, agitated psychotic is an  uncompromising portrait of a sad, creepy wreck. Miranda Richardson is equally disturbing in  the dual roles of his demure mother and a Cockney tart who personify the mother-whore  dichotomy that obsesses Dennis. The recurrent imagery of spider webs, jigsaw puzzles  and tangled string adds an extra layer of poetic creepiness. &#151; Stephen Holden",18431,1

The Greens —  especially Grandpa and Sun, a radiant environmentalist —  share  their creator's stubborn defiance as they take on the media, the government  and the soul-destroying, earth-polluting power of big corporations. The 10 songs that blanket the soundtrack are stripped-down anthems and   lamentations, and they secure Mr. Young's position as an inimitable —  and indispensable —  rock 'n' roll prophet. — A. O.

"Early on Feb. 27, 1943, under the waning cover of dark, Berlin`s remaining Jews were rounded up for what the Reich euphemistically referred to as deportation. While most of the detainees were doomed, some 1,700 men, women and children were diverted to a former Jewish community center on Rosenstrasse. Segregated because they were either married to non-Jewish Germans or the progeny of such marriages, the prisoners huddled together while outside, their German relatives, women mostly, initiated an unprecedented protest against the Nazi terror machine. In &quot;Rosenstrasse,&quot; the German director Margarethe von Trotta revisits this relatively obscure episode from Germany's Nazi past to dismally inept effect. Known for politically charged movies about tough women, Ms. von Trotta here foregoes the typical historical reconstruction and instead attempts to put the past and the present into conversation. Because she isn't a historian it's arguable that her allegiance to the historical record need not be as firm as her commitment to her art, which at least here appears tenuous at best. That reasoning would certainly fly better if the filmmaker didn't try to wrench an object lesson about female empowerment from the Rosenstrasse protest. &#151; Manohla Dargis",18490,1

"This sequel to &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; (2001) is a movie for people who somehow managed to miss the point of the first picture, itself the kind of material that put the b in subtle, as the old joke goes. And old jokes is really what &quot;Blonde 2&quot; is all about. Reese Witherspoon returns as Elle Woods, the indefatigable sprig of a girl whose disposition is as sunshiny as her hair. Previously, she conquered Harvard Law School, a venue in need of a new world order, and in the nominal sequel, she takes on the moribund legislative branch in Washington. Elle is working as an aide to Representative Rudd (Sally Field), a fellow Delta Nu. Probably the funniest thing in the picture is seeing these Oscar-sized forces of nature: Ms. Witherspoon, the most determined actress of the 21st century, is posed pert nose-to-nose with Ms. Field, whose blurted &quot;You really like me&quot; sentiment disguised a will equally steely. But Charles Herman-Wurmfeld and the writer Kate Kondell don't make enough of this match-up. Instead, &quot;Blonde 2&quot; is repetitive rather than reiterative, going over the same material as the first. The snappy, happy Elle is ridiculed by Rudd's worldly and world-weary aides, especially the tough, crude Grace (Regina King). So, Elle has to wear them down, win them over, yet still find time to get married. The movie assumes not only that Elle did not learn anything from the first movie, but that its lessons of perseverance and open-mindedness were lost on audiences, too. — Elvis Mitchell",18517,1
"This sequel revives the raucous high spirits of its predecessor, with some new characters, jokes and satiric targets to compensate for the loss of novelty. Shrek (Mike Myers) and Fiona (Cameron Diaz), now married, travel with Donkey (Eddie Murphy) to meet Shrek's in-laws, the king and queen of Far Far Away, which is to Hollywood what Duloc was to Disney in the first &quot;Shrek.&quot; There they contend with a scheming fairy godmother (Jennifer Saunders), and a swashbuckling, scene-stealing Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas). The animation has improved, and the cross-generational appeal — slapstick and moralizing for the kids, cheekiness and pop music for the grownups — is precisely calibrated and jauntily executed. Still, the cynicism of the enterprise leaves a bit of a sour taste. The movie is too timid to risk genuine ugliness, and too crude to try for real beauty. — A. O. Scott",18518,1

"As in their previous collaboration, &quot;Being John Malkovich,&quot; Spike Jonze and the screenwriter Charlie Kaufman concoct an intricate, scrambled parallel universe populated by anxious, itchy people, some appearing really to exist. The hero is Mr. Kaufman himself (Nicolas Cage), a screenwriter struggling to adapt &quot;The Orchid Thief,&quot; Susan Orlean's nonfiction meditation on flowers, obsession and Darwinian theory. He is tormented by writer's block and by his twin brother, Donald (also Mr. Cage), an aspiring screenwriter and all-around doofus in his own right. Their sibling rivalry, which is also a metaphor for the pains of creativity, is interspersed with something that looks like an actual adaptation of &quot;The Orchid Thief,&quot; in which Ms. Orlean (Meryl Streep) finds herself drawn to a scruffy renegade botanist named John Laroche (Chris Cooper). Then the plots overlap, collide and explode in a conclusion that is at once maddening, troubling and oddly moving. This is a remarkable, impossible movie — about itself but also about its own nonexistence — and one of the most formally audacious, intellectually charged American movies in quite some time. — A. O.

The story of a family reunion that becomes a black-tie psyche-bashing blowout is told with a hand-held camera, without any special lighting or props or sound, and the effect is invigorating rather than austere. Imaginative angles, nimble editing and fluid, agile camera work keep the film spinning as a large Danish cast makes the festivities seem utterly real. The central drama is Shakespeare for the tell-all age, as a patriarch is haunted by past sins and vengeful children. &quot;It is quite a job being toastmaster tonight,&quot; says one partygoer, putting it mildly. &#151; Janet Maslin",18561,1

Kieran Culkin and Emile Hirsch are schoolmates, pranksters and collaborators on a comic book whose characters, including a monstrous caricature of their school's mother superior (Jodie Foster), are extensions of events and people in their lives.

Its talking heads, many of  them Texan journalistic and political veterans who have tangled with Mr. Rove, portray  him as the ultimate win-at-all-costs practitioner of dirty politics, Even if few if any of the  movie's allegations of Mr. Rove's unethical behavior can be proved, the dirty tricks laid  at his doorstep leave you with the sickening feeling that it is s no longer possible in  American politics to stay out of the gutter, unless, of course you want to lose.

"Is it possible to explain a phenomenon like Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious serial killer who murdered 17 men and cannibalized parts of their bodies? Or are the social forces that shaped him the same pressures that thousands of other people have endured without being driven to kill? David Jacobson's serious, well-acted docudrama falls headlong into the trap of imagining that it can somehow rationalize the monstrous. Dahmer, who pleaded insanity at his murder trial, was convicted on all counts in 1992 and sentenced to 1,070 years in prison. Two years later he was killed by a fellow inmate. As gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character, there remains a huge gap between the film's creepy, clean-cut Dahmer (Jeremy Renner) and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge. — Stephen Holden",18591,1

It's eight years later, and they're now married and raising their son, Alex (Freddie Boath), in addition to keeping the 1930's safe from the returning mummy (Arnold Vosloo).

Julia Roberts, miscast but charming nonetheless, is a free-spirited Californian who moves East to teach art history at demure, snooty Wellesley College in 1953 and shakes up the place enough to be deemed subversive. Appalled to discover that her brilliant, privileged students have no post-graduate ambitions beyond marrying and settling down, she preaches emancipation.

"This remarkable if overlong Korean film strips away much of the sentimentality and goody-two-shoes attitudes that the movies traditionally attach to disabled people. At the same time, it coolly indicts an indifferent world that treats its misfits as inconvenient, half-witted children who are easily exploited and abused. Shortly after Hong Jong-Du (Sol Kyung-gu), the learning-disabled middle brother of three sons  in a bourgeois Korean family, returns home after serving three years in prison, he  meets the more seriously disabled Han Gong-Ju (Moon So-ri), who suffers from cerebral  palsy so severe she can't make herself understood. The passionate bond that develops between them brings them joy but leads to personal disaster. The film's extraordinary lead performances refuse to soft-pedal the severity of their afflictions. By not turning away, softening or adopting a saccharine tone, the film breaks through the couple's  isolation (and through our own prejudice and frustration) so that the sweethearts emerge  as full, achingly human characters. &#151; Stephen Holden",18705,1
"Richard Day's comedy is classic drag. Evie (Jack Plotnock) is the witch, but a sympathetic one, as she watches the tape of her one starring role in a movie, &quot;Asteroid,&quot; again and again. Coco (Clinton Leupp) is the depressive, still in love with the abortion doctor she met when she was a teenager. Varla (Jeffery Roberson) is the innocent, Evie and Coco's new roommate, a newcomer to Hollywood determined to break into the movie business. Or has she come to avenge her mother's untimely death at a pool party? No one in the cast is likely to be the next Charles Busch, but the film is appropriately cynical, pleasantly camp and fresh enough to be funny more often than not. — Anita Gates",18706,1

"Much of the deliciousness of this piece of cinematic candy, adapted from Helen Fielding's best-selling novel, emanates from Renée Zellweger's irresistibly endearing portrayal of the slightly kooky 32-year-old title character. The quick-witted screenplay keeps the pace snappy and the tone lightly satirical as Bridget trolls through London media circles in search of Mr. Right. Eventually the film loses its edge and turns into a variation of Cinderella (by way of Jane Austen). Hugh Grant (even better here, in his serpentine mode, than as a male ingénue) and Colin Firth (grimly heroic but with a redeeming twinkle) are just about perfect as the Mr. Wrong and Mr. Right who come to fisticuffs over Bridget's affections. — Stephen Holden",18713,1

"&quot;See Spot Run&quot; is pure Hollywood formula all the way. Its hero, F.B.I. Agent 11, a k a Spot, is a specially trained mastiff who in the movie's crime-busting opening scene removes a testicle from Sonny Talia (Paul Sorvino), a buffoonish mob boss. This impromptu surgery leaves Sonny so peeved that he sics his goons on a fruitless mission to eliminate the invincible Spot. Enter Gordon (David Arquette), a grinning, dog-phobic Seattle postman. Spot, kidnapped by his would-be assassins while en route to a safe house, escapes and hides out in Gordon's mail truck.

"The animated feature &quot;Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron&quot; is ostensibly about the herds of wild horses that once roamed the West, though the film may be more closely concerned with another endangered species: the animated film as a hand-drawn, hand-painted artifact. Working with pixels rather than pencils, animators can now create volumes, textures and spaces with a three-dimensional solidity that has come to make the old methods suddenly look flat and insubstantial. As it stands, &quot;Spirit&quot; provides neither the profound human touch of the great Disney animation of the past, nor the dazzling, high-tech fun of present-day digital cartooning. For children raised on the digital gleam of the Pixar features (&quot;Toy Story,&quot; &quot;A Bug's Life,&quot; etc.), &quot;Spirit&quot; will seem as ordinary as Saturday morning television. &#151; Dave Kehr",18724,1

"In this minimalist disaster movie, an unspecified ecological catastrophe has disrupted modern life, and some of the survivors, huddled together in a bleak corner of the French countryside, struggle to hold on to the trappings of civilization. Food and water are scarce, and so is kindness, which the director Michael Haneke rations out with elegant sang-froid. The movie is rigorously harsh, and its view of human nature is as dark as the cinematography, which forces you to discern human features in twilight, deep fog and utter darkness. Isabelle Huppert, who played the unhinged musician in Mr. Haneke's &quot;Piano Teacher,&quot; is a mother trying to protect her two children and her own sense of identity amid chaos and desperation. Mr. Haneke's formal control is impressive, but his steely resistance to sensationalism or sentimentality can be repellent. You may find yourself horrified and disturbed by this all-too-plausible nightmare —  and shamed by the thought that, in some parts of the world, it represents real life —  without being especially moved by it. — A.

The outcome is a spewing mess. In Panama, six Army Rangers go out on a training exercise, led  by their volatile, violently demanding — and, of course, violently detested — troop leader, Sergeant West (Samuel L. Jackson). When only two of the men return alive, an investigation begins. Hardy (John Travolta), a bad-apple D.E.A. agent and former Ranger, is brought in to find out what went wrong. &quot;Basic&quot; is so desperate to get to its nonsensical ending that it sinks to having a dying man write a clue in his own blood. Probably the reason most people will be interested in &quot;Basic&quot; is for a re-teaming of Mr. Travolta and Mr. Jackson for the first time since &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot; They have only a moment together, and this picture could have the effect of negating the heat &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; put under them. — Elvis Mitchell",18745,1

In his haste, Gavin accidentally leaves a valuable legal document with Doyle. This is when &quot;Changing Lanes&quot; becomes &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; with a Road Runner cartoon added. In this instance, though, it's like a Road Runner cartoon with dueling Wile E. Coyotes, with acts of escalating violence on each side as  the men try to chip the other's hide, and soul.

This kind of large-scale, epic filmmaking has long been out of style in Hollywood, and it is thrilling to see it revived here. The story, based on the bloody history of 16th-century Thailand, combines palace intrigue and battlefield mayhem, and it shows the central role women played in Thailand's military and political history. The heroine, Suryiothai, is noble and steadfast, but nowhere near as vivid as Srisudachan, a conniving courtesan who rises to power like a Siamese Lady Macbeth, leaving a trail of poisoned and beheaded corpses behind her. — A.

"The American film industry may be the world's leading purveyor of violent action blockbusters, but &quot;Shiri,&quot; by the South Korean director Kang Je-Gyu, is the latest evidence that Hollywood does not hold a monopoly on fireballs, reckless driving and automatic-weapons fire. At the center of the movie are two South Korean special agents who must prevent the northerners from blowing up half of Seoul. Mr. Kang has a free hand with  action-movie clichés and a tendency to put violent kineticism above coherence, traits that suggest an affection for the bullet-riddled Hong Kong action movies of John Woo and Tsui Hark. – A. O. Scott",18872,1
"As every red-blooded American male is at least partially  aware, 1972 was the year that camping trips lost their innocence. That was when the  movie &quot;Deliverance&quot; introduced a new specter into the horror show of macho nightmares.  Thanks to &quot;Deliverance&quot; and many subsequent rip-offs, every camper knows that behind  every tree may lurk a sadistic, rotten-toothed hillbilly itching to rape a soft city slicker  and make him squeal like a pig in front of his friends. The homosexual panic instilled  by &quot;Deliverance&quot; fuels the running joke (if that's the word for it) driving the uneasy  laughs evoked by this loathsome comedy in which three buddies, aged 30 going on 13,  embark on a ridiculous treasure hunt in the Pacific Northwest. &#151; Stephen Holden",18873,1

"Eric Schaeffer's contemporary sex comedy poses that age-old question: Can a desperately lonely 54-year-old exterminator find happiness with a desperately lonely 54-year-old single mother whom he meets in a gay bar? Yes, yes, yes, the movie gushes, despite the evidence before your eyes that these two people have nothing in common except advanced cases of commitment-phobia and a numerical similarity in age. It's no fault of Jeffrey Tambor, who plays Christopher the exterminator, and Jill Clayburgh, his sweetie pie, Grace, that this relationship appears ludicrous. Comedy, even farce, has to have some grounding in recognizable human behavior if it's to land. But as conceived by Mr. Schaeffer, Christopher and Grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell. &#151; Stephen Holden",18911,1

"In &quot;The Believer,&quot; winner of the grand jury prize at last year's Sundance Film Festival, a young Jew helps his skinhead friends desecrate and try to destroy a synagogue. He doesn't protest when one of them urinates from the balcony, but some residual religiosity makes him urge the others to stop tossing around a Torah and put it back where they got it. He is Danny Balint, presented as a clever Yeshiva student who has grown up to be a neo-Nazi. As played by Ryan Gosling, Danny is bursting with ideas as well as with self-loathing and ambivalence. This willfully provocative film portrait offers lots of raging, vulgarity and shock but little insight into the character's psychopathology. Like Danny, the movie fulminates with inchoate thoughts and proceeds with more energy than coherence. — Julie Salamon",18929,1

"Although the title  character of Julie Bertuccelli's film is seen only fleetingly in blurry  snapshots, his presence haunts the imaginations of the three women at the center of this  beautifully written and acted drama. Otar, a medical student from the former Soviet  republic of Georgia, has fled the bleak, crumbling city of Tblisi, where he grew up, to live  in Paris where he is struggling to make his way without a visa. Left behind are his doting  mother (Esther Gorintin), his sister (Nino  Khomassouridze) and his sister's daughter (Dinara  Droukarova). Like Chekhov's &quot;Three Sisters,&quot; &quot;Since Otar Left&quot; is about yearning as a  life force. The mother, a painfully stooped, hobbling old woman, lives for her son's  occasional phone calls and letters. When word comes that Otar has died in a construction  accident, the sister and granddaughter, afraid to break the news, put on a charade, writing   bogus letters that spur the mother to journey to Paris to see her son. The film sustains a  fine balance of pathos, humor and a clear-headed realism. — Stephen Holden",18934,1

"&quot;Just a Kiss,&quot; an urban sex comedy that is a little too smart for its own good, reminds us that members of Manhattan's 30-something semi-hipoisie are just as prone to infidelity and ranting sexual jealousy as the low-rent domestic warriors in a Jerry Springer sideshow. These urbanites' language may be sharper and their games more refined, but their emotions are just as raw. This movie, directed by the actor Fisher Stevens from a screenplay by Patrick Breen, crisscrosses the romantic lives of a gallery of sharply drawn New York caricatures whose tit-for-tat bed hopping eventually lands three of them in the hospital. What elevates the movie above the run-of-the-mill singles blender is its surreal sense of humor and technological finish. Before it ends, the movie allows its characters to go back in time and make different, less destructive choices. &#151; Stephen Holden",18948,1

As it blazes its gnashing and snarling trail, &quot;Resident Evil&quot; forces a shaky alliance between two subgenres: the futuristic techno-thriller and the zombie screamfest. The plot, such as it is, follows a group of commandos, led by Alice (Milla Jovovich) and Rain (Michelle Rodriguez), into an underground laboratory to isolate a lab-engineered virus that reanimates the body after death. When they discover that research staff members have metamorphosed into the undead and are out to devour them, the movie becomes an escape thriller. – Stephen Holden",18995,1

"To describe the sex scenes in Claire Denis's erotic horror film as indelible isn't to say they are the least bit inviting or easy to watch.

The squeamish are strongly advised to avoid the film, which created a minor scandal when it was shown last spring at the Cannes Film Festival. The story of &quot;Trouble Every Day,&quot; by  Ms. Denis and Jean-Pol Fargeau, is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary  notes for a science-fiction horror film, and the movie's fragmentary narrative style makes  piecing the story together frustratingly difficult. – Stephen Holden",18997,1

"Crisply directed by Kevin Bray, the film is a remake of the Nixon-era law-and-order hit of the same name, which was set in a Tennessee town taken over by vice peddlers and starred Joe Don Baker as Sheriff Buford Pusser, a no-nonsense guy who cleaned up the town with the help of a huge wooden club. In the new film, the action has been transposed to Washington State (probably to allow the producers to shoot in the budget-friendly confines of British Columbia), and the Southern sheriff has become a Special Forces veteran who returns to find his hometown, once a cozy logging community nestled in a mountain valley, turned into a hellish den of iniquity.  With a brisk running time of 85 minutes, there is no more fat on &quot;Walking Tall&quot; than there is on the Rock himself, a hulking yet curiously ingratiating presence who seems the most likely candidate to replace Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger as America's favorite living comic book character. — Dave Kehr",19077,1

"Eric Rohmer, France's premier anatomist of late-20th-century romantic confusion, turns his attention to the political turmoil of the 18th century. Using digital video and hand-painted backdrops, the director has made a gripping, contrarian costume drama that is also very much a Rohmer film, full of passionate argument and rueful irony. Lucy Russell plays Grace Elliott, an English expatriate whose loyalty to the French monarchy places her in danger during the revolutionary terror of the early 1790's. Jean-Claude Dreyfus is her devoted friend and former lover, the Duke of Orleans, whose principles are far less steadfast. Mr. Rohmer's sensibility is so uncannily in tune with the period that you feel you are watching a recovered masterpiece of 18th-century cinema. — A. O. Scott",19096,1

As timely as a damp headline or a CNN crawl, &quot;Hero&quot; rips its text from the seething border tensions between India and Pakistan, spices its conflict with hot-tempered religious zealots bent on nuclear havoc and employs its saintly but deadly title character to tell a grandly romantic tale that exalts humanity and patriotism, elevates country above self-interest, deplores the perversion of Muslim faith and sermonizes on the true meaning of jihad. — Lawrence Van Gelder",19107,1

This is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action. The formulaic plot finds Leon  (Stephen Dorff) and Bobby (Brad Renfro), his hot-headed brother and fellow gang member, at philosophical loggerheads. Where Leon urges restraint in the Deuces' continuing turf war with the rival Vipers, Bobby is itching for a fight. Loyalties begin to crumble when Bobby starts dating Annie (Fairuza Balk), the tough sister of a Viper leader. Hunky hoods and their hot babes itching for a rumble on the sweaty streets of Brooklyn in those fabulous 50's? Maybe it's time the movies gave them a long, long rest. &#151; Stephen Holden",19109,1

Ben Affleck, who suggests one of the Kennedys playing Clark Kent he wants to keep his light under a bushel, but he's not quite up to it - plays Rudy, an ex-con who gets dragged into a casino heist planned for the Christmas season. Charlize Theron is the girl who lures him into the job. The seamy kicks of one double cross after another keep the movie in motion, and John Frankeheimer's ruthless precision keeps it on track. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",19279,1

"The title of Robert Altman's likable new film could be an appropriate choice for any of his most important movies, from &quot;McCabe and Mrs. Miller&quot; to &quot;Kansas City.&quot; Many of these pictures invite us to eavesdrop on a group of characters busily talking among themselves, sounding like nervous, supportive actors revving up for a performance before the curtain rises. &quot;Company,&quot; which follows a Chicago-based dance troupe through a few months of its regular season, with the clashes and ego-bruising that accompanies the performances, is enjoyably lithe and droll, yet somehow almost water soluble. The movie, which uses members of the Joffrey Ballet, almost seems to dissolve onscreen before your eyes. Mr. Altman and the screenwriter Barbara Turner have too astringent a perspective to cheapen the picture with thrashing soap opera; the few attempts to create competitive tension in the film dissipate even faster than other elements. Such choices mean that this movie lacks a center. — Elvis Mitchell",19302,1

"Neither an atrocity nor a revelation, &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot; is a very watchable, often beautiful-looking attempt by the director Vincent Gallo to reproduce the kind of loosely structured mood pieces that found American and select foreign-language cinemas of the 1960's and 70's often at their most adventurous, with Monte Hellman's 1971 &quot;Two-Lane Blacktop&quot; the most obvious touchstone. Mr. Gallo plays Bud Clay, a motorcycle racer (and the title's symbolic bunny) on his way back home to Los Angeles from a New Hampshire meet. As Bud racks up miles, he stares moodily at the road, visits a childhood haunt, eats a lonely meal, sleeps a lonely motel sleep, takes his motorcycle for a spin and exchanges small talk with a few women, all of whom have the soft, bruised look of chronic disappointment. Eventually, Bud hits Los Angeles, where he checks into a hotel, and where yet another flower of femininity, Chloe Sevigny's Daisy, gives the film its back-story and furnishes what the porn industry calls, in rather more direct language, its economic raison d'etre. — Manohla Dargis",19334,1

"Perhaps the world doesn't need another picture on disaffected youth, but Jia Zhang Ke's film is about more than alienation. The saddest thing about it is that the social ineptitude of the youth in &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; doesn't even belong to them: they've sampled it from Western culture, just like the clangorous funk of dance-club music. But being immersed in pop  culture doesn't set the kids of &quot;Pleasures&quot; free; it's just another signpost of the things they can't have.  The hand-held sparseness in which the camera roams around large, mostly underpopulated and rundown spaces makes &quot;Pleasures&quot; feel a bit repetitive — reductive neo-realism. There are a few long takes that can be numbing, but they're part of the director's point. The movie wants to confront us with the fact that these kids are going nowhere and are in no particular hurry. It treats Beijing as the Moscow of &quot;The Three Sisters&quot;: a dreamland as a receding horizon.  — Elvis Mitchell",19373,1

Since it has already gone like clockwork four times (each abduction netting them a cool quarter of a million dollars without a hitch or an injury), they are unprepared when the fifth couple on their hit list, an anesthesiologist and his wife (Stuart Townsend and Charlize Theron), fight back. The film is a reasonably efficient mechanism, but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided. &quot;Trapped&quot; arrives at a moment when the headlines are full of child abductions.

Which it does, on Meg's very first night of residence, when three quarrelsome bad guys arrive in search of hidden treasure. In spite of David Fincher's smooth, scary visual style, and his virtuosity with both traditional and computer-aided camera techniques, the movie is chilly and lacking in suspense. You pretty much know what will happen, and never really care about any of the characters.

"In the summer of 1981, five people were beaten with lead pipes, four of them fatally, in a house in Los Angeles, apparently in revenge for an earlier robbery. The crime was notable for its brutality, and also because it appeared to implicate John Holmes, the legendary porn star who knew the victims. In reconstructing the crime, James Cox has made an aggressively stylish, blithely sleazy whodunit that might be described as &quot;Law and Order&quot; on crack. Val Kilmer, as Holmes, is antic, needy and occasionally charming, and the rest of the cast seems to enjoy the hyperactively scuzzy ambience of drugs, guns and classic rock. Lisa Kudrow, playing Holmes's estranged wife, Sharon, stands out from the rest. Her severity and restraint, and the opacity of her motives, make her the only interesting character in a movie that, while sometimes absorbing, ultimately feels pointless. — A. O. Scott",19415,1
"Gary Ross's adaptation of Laura Hillenbrand's swift-moving, sweeping best seller is serious, decorous, and not as thrilling as it might be. The voiceover narration by David McCullough, and the Ken Burns-style archival stills give it an air of public television worthiness that undercuts the excitement of the racing sequences. The story, of a runty, crooked-legged horse who became the biggest media celebrity in Depression-weary America, is impossible not to embrace, and Mr. Ross tells it with efficiency and professionalism. The movie is successful —  it gives you a sense of the times, and of the colorful human characters whose lives were entwined with Seabiscuit's — but it is also disappointing. The cast includes some of the finest actors working in movies today, but with the partial exception of Chris Cooper (as the horse's enigmatic, taciturn trainer), they are confined by the film's schematic, simplified storytelling. Jeff Bridges, as Charles Howard, Seabiscuit's owner, and Tobey Maguire, who plays his principal jockey, the unlucky Red Pollard, are both thoroughbreds. If only Mr. Ross had eased up on the reins and let them run. — A.O. Scott",19416,1

"&quot;I survived because they liked my paintings,&quot; says Vann Nath in this unsettling documentary, an affecting and effective film. This placid artist was imprisoned along with 17,000 other Cambodians in a Phnom Penh high school that had been converted into a Khmer Rouge interrogation and torture center. The school was used for this purpose for two years during the Khmer Rouge reign of terror (1975 to 1979), when as many as a million people died. In the film, he returns there to confront the men who worked as guards, really boys doing the Devil's work: at the time, they ranged from 13 to their early 20's. At one point the director shows the former guards recreating their grisly everyday tasks as a kind of pantomime. Watching them re-enact their chores in the large, stained and now empty rooms, which look like those in almost any American high school — while piles of the dead prisoners' abandoned clothes sit heaped nearby — is simply one of the most disorienting moments you're likely to encounter in a movie. — Elvis Mitchell",19451,1

"Woody Allen's latest exercise in pretentious miniaturism might be a fitting companion piece to &quot;Small Time Crooks&quot; (or for that matter to the earlier, better &quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot; or &quot;Manhattan Murder Mystery&quot;). It's a loose-jointed, not especially memorable comic caper with some lovely moments of humorous invention, many patches of clumsy writing ad a few game performances. Mr. Allen plays an insurance investigator in 1940 who falls afoul of a nefarious hypnotist and clashes with Helen Hunt, who plays his co-worker and nemesis. In spite of its evident nostalgia for the cruder sexual politics of bygone days, the movie is as innocuous as it is pointless, and Mr. Allen's lame attempts at Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder wit are as clumsy as Santo Loquasto's period sets are meticulous. - A.

The story is somewhat more somber than usual &#151; Benji's master is a frightened 14-year-old boy, with a brutal stepfather and a browbeaten mother, who has to protect his pet against both his father and a pair of bumbling dogcatchers &#151; but there is generous comic relief as well as plenty of cutaways to lovable mutts. &#151; Dave Kehr",19497,1

"This ambitious fusion of cartoons and live-action  comedy has loads of nerve but is only fitfully amusing. The animated characters Daffy  Duck and Bugs Bunny interact with Drendan Fraser and Jenna Elfman, as Warner Bros. employees. At every turn, you can sense the filmmakers' jitters as they pack more and  more extraneous stuff into each scene. The absurd spy plot, which borrows heavily from  the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; movies, is half-smothered under the tonnage of pop-culture  references. And the movie, which sustains the sheer dizzying speed of a Saturday-morning  cartoon for 90 minutes, is exhausting to watch.  But when this mad dash of a comedy  pauses to catch its breath, it has a moment or two of pure cinematic wonder. The wittiest  feat of magic is a sequence set at the Louvre in which Daffy Duck and Bugs  gleefully hop in and out of famous paintings, including the Mona Lisa and Munch's &quot;Scream.&quot; — Stephen Holden",19502,1

"This is probably an unusual but perhaps apt time for this intelligent drama, easily one of the finest pictures of 2003 or any other year. Tareque Masud's expansive fluidity is rapturous, inspired equally by the floating equanimity of Satyajit Ray and the work of the Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami, who deftly uses ritual behavior to provide social commentary. Set in Bangladesh in the 1960's, &quot;The Clay Bird&quot; questions the nature of dedication to Islam. It doesn't attack fealty but eventually rebukes zealotry by showing a boy's reaction to his father's recent total immersion.  Anu (Nurul Islam Bablu) is sent off to a religious school by his father, Kazi (Jayanto Chattopadhyay). Kazi doesn't want his son tainted by the outside world. His obedient though doubtful wife, Ayesha (Rokeya Prachy), quietly expresses through frowns her concern about Kazi's close-minded new seriousness. She gently reasons with her boy, and the bright Anu resigns himself to his new life.  Mr. Masud's sensitivity gives the film a pungent emotional clarity; he recognizes that naïveté isn't a province only of childhood. Kazi's a naïf, too, and learns the hard way that following a path without independent thought is a fool's errand. He's ultimately devastated when he learns of the civil war and Muslims attacking other Muslims: the revolution is coming, and it claims Kazi's way of life. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",19517,1

The movie, directed by Wayne Wang from a script he wrote  with the novelists Paul Auster and Siri Hustvedt under the collective pseudonym Ellen Benjamin Wong, is one of those films, often considered  a French specialty, that takes sex so seriously as to make you wonder why anyone would bother with it. &#151; A.

"A competent and compact though unsurprising re-creation of the events surrounding the Cuban missile crisis, with Kevin Costner — as President John F. Kennedy's right-hand man, Kenny O'Donnell — graciously bowing out of the way to allow the president (Bruce Greenwood) and his brother Robert (Steven Culp) center stage. Costner's moving to the sidelines is as ostentatious as his Boston Brahmin accent — he seems to be channeling Vaughn Meader. But the director Roger Donaldson, despite having more confrontation scenes than all of the other Kennedy dramatization projects combined, brings an athletic rigor to the film. The movie is helped by Greenwood's crisp, intense President Kennedy: he's like a White House portrait come to life. -- Elvis Mitchell",19532,1

"The elegant and deeply disquieting story of two suburban families whose lives change irrevocably during the title event, which has takes on mystical force not often seen in films about wayward weather. Adapting Rick Moody's observant novel, the director of ''Sense and Sensibility'' uses his own quiet acuity to make a Connecticut bedroom community, circa 1973, seem as strange and distant as any Austeniana; no, much more so. Beautifully and mournfully acted, especially by those who play the women of this well-heeled Pompeii. The vulgar excesses of the time period and the delicacy of Ang Lee's direction form a haunting combination. — Janet Maslin",19564,1
"Spike Lee's movie sets the story of a convicted drug dealer's last night of freedom against the backdrop of post-9/11 New York, and while the story doesn't entirely cohere or mesh with the setting, the film works as a lovely, moving succession of moods, sounds and images. (Terence Blanchard's gorgeous score helps a lot.) Edward Norton, as Monty Brogan, the prison-bound dealer, has a scrappy, mercurial intelligence, and the work of the supporting cast (especially Brian Cox as Monty's father, a retired fireman; Rosario Dawson as Monty's girlfriend; and Barry Pepper as one of his childhood friends) is a reminder of how generous Mr. Lee can be with actors. The final sequence &#151; one of Mr. Lee's signature flights of invention in an otherwise naturalistic film &#151; is a crazy, moving evocation of the absurdity and tenacity of the American Dream. — A. O. Scott",19565,1
"This curious hybrid of documentary, fictional feature and graduate-school seminar paper explores the peculiar dynamics of psychoanalysis. The most interesting sections are interviews with practicing analysts (all of them old, white and male), during which Amie  Siegel manages to unsettle their professional composure with blunt, clever questions. These sessions give way to a meandering exploration of the daily life of a fictional woman (Gigi Buffington) being treated for depression by an actual analyst. The layering of reality and fiction is intricate and provocative &#151; we see Ms. Buffington's screen test, as well as a cast party at which the shrinks mingle with the actors and the crew &#151; but ultimately Ms. Siegel's insights are lost in the self-congratulatory complexity of her formal experiments. — A.

The cast, which also includes Dennis Quaid as Cathy's unhappy   husband and Patricia Clarkson as her poisonously compassionate best friend, is uniformly superb. The movie transcends irony or caricature, and reminds us how humane and how artful melodrama can be. — A. O. Scott",19568,1

"Filmed mostly in shades of gray, this sleek, desolate fable about the conflict between corporate values and human needs gives the upscale ethos that engulfs its characters a bleak palette all its own. The central  character, Christoffer (Ulrich Thomsen), forsakes a carefree life in Stockholm to assume  control of his family's floundering steel works after his father commits suicide. Part of  the story revolves around the tug of war between his domineering mother (Ghita Norby)  and his beautiful wife (Lisa Werlinder), who puts her promising acting career on hold to move from Stockholm to Copenhagen. &quot;The Inheritance&quot; reminds you in painful detail that one of the tasks of a financially responsible executive is to execute. As he turns the business around, his decisions tear apart his family and erode his marriage. You can read the Danish film as an unsettling parable about any corporation, or, for that matter, any country forced to take stringent financial measures to avoid catastrophe. For all the pain he inflicts, Christoffer might even be seen as a self-sacrificing hero. But as the morose movie shows, a corporate hero is many ways the antithesis of a humanitarian. — Stephen Holden",19595,1

Étienne Sauret's intimate, heartbreaking documentaries, &quot;Collateral Damages,&quot; which interviews several firefighters, and the near-wordless &quot;The First 24 Hours,&quot; return to those primal events and their immediate aftermath. Both films are meditations on the scale of a catastrophe so enormous that all the assembled rescue resources seem paltry and inadequate. Many grief-stricken, traumatized words are uttered in &quot;Collateral Damages,&quot; a personal scrapbook of the memories of several firefighters who survived the horrors.

"Even though the setting isn't a penal institution but a convent, Peter Mullan's grim, powerful film fits snugly into a long line of heartsick dramas in which innocent people endure the degradation of prison. The inmates, all female, are the victims of a stringently moralistic brand of Irish Catholicism, now on the wane, that used to punish unmarried young women (many in their teens) for premarital sex.  These &quot;bad girls&quot; exiled from their families and communities were forced to do slave labor in convent laundries that proliferated in Ireland until recently. &quot;The Magdalene Sisters,&quot; which tells the semifictionalized stories of four young women in one convent, is set roughly from 1964 to 1969.   Most prison movies have a monster authority figure, and so does this film. Here that ogre is the head nun, Sister Bridget (Geraldine McEwan), a twisted diabolical autocrat. In a brilliant performance, Ms. McEwan makes this character horribly believable by portraying her cruelty not as raw sadism but as righteous punishment dispensed by a religious fanatic with a warped sense of values. — Stephen Holden",19699,1

"Another marvel from Satoshi Kon, whose first two films, &quot;Perfect Blue&quot; and &quot;Millennium Actress,&quot; have already pushed Japanese feature-length animation toward greater realism and wilder fantasy. Loosely based on &quot;3 Godfathers,&quot; John Ford's maudlin 1948 western, this movie, a sweet fable of decency amid the down and out, also has echoes of Chaplin and Capra. Three homeless people — an embittered alcoholic, a middle-aged transvestite and a teenage runaway — find an abandoned baby on Christmas Eve. As they try to reunite the foundling with her parents, they revisit their own unhappy lives, and travel through a city rendered with unbelievable precision and tinted with undeniable love. The potentially sticky sentiments of the story are balanced by a crazily inventive narrative and by Mr. Kon's cool, obsessively detailed visual style. At the end, the skyscrapers of Tokyo wriggle and dance to a Japanese-language techno version of Beethoven's &quot;Ode to Joy,&quot; which pretty much sums up this indescribable, unforgettable movie. — A.

"This is a reimagining of the original B-picture with a few touches of wit, and even fewer touches of imagination. Asexual and loud, the new film has been reconfigured for 6-year-olds with an ending that's really surprising. (It doesn't make any sense.) Mark Wahlberg is the hero this time, an American astronaut who's flung through a wormhole and crash-lands on a world where apes rule. Polite and steely, he is simply cast as the good guy instead of fulfilling the role. In Tim Burton's version, the apes don't bounce like marionettes; they're proud to be apes, and in the scary battle scenes, they charge across a field like thundering primates. This stampede of hairy cannonballs is a bad dream come to life. Helena Bonham Carter is an ape with sympathies for mistreated humans and she uses her voice resourcefully. But the movie belongs to Tim Roth, as the preening, ambitious General Thade - so much so that he even gets the best makeup job. - Elvis Mitchell",19725,1

Although the movies haven't lacked for Hamlets recently, Ethan Hawke and Kenneth Branagh being the latest stars to have weighed in, Mr. Scott's is something that must be seen. It is, in a word, compelling. — Stephen Holden",19732,1

When Karel finds a tree stump that reminds him of a baby and brings it to Bozena, she hungrily lavishes it with maternal care and demands they treat it as a real child. Because this Czech master refuses to work in the scrubbed, antiseptic manner of most animators, this fable comes to life as hilarious and creepy. Finally, though, because of its obvious, reductive condescension, the picture is a half-hour too long. – Elvis Mitchell",19761,1

"Michel Gondry's film, an angular and intelligent romantic comedy, isn't entirely consistent. Even as you laugh, it's a movie you admire more than love. Mr. Gondry, displaying an impressively quicksilver, scrambling technique, is working with a much better script than he had for &quot;Human Nature,&quot; his previous collaboration with the screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (&quot;Being John Malkovich,&quot; &quot;Adaptation&quot;).  Kate Winslet is Clem, the brash, loquacious bookstore employee who meets Joel (Jim Carrey) as he wanders the streets alone on Valentine's Day. The two of them fall in love under a glum, flannel cloud cover that could use some eternal sunshine.  After they break up, Joel's ego is bruised when he finds out that Clem has had all memories of him erased from her mind. Devastated, he goes for the same treatment. Mr. Kaufman has conjured the film equivalent of a Philip K. Dick Hallmark card. The movie has all of the knickknacks of a Kaufman script, including a nerdy, socially inept protagonist. In the case of &quot;Mind,&quot; this translates into Joel's being the least developed character. Mr. Carrey does get to show some aplomb in the final scene, when Joel acts out the most mature sentiment ever found in a Kaufman script, that having one's psyche purged isn't necessarily a good thing. What becomes of the broken-hearted, after the conversation has dimmed, is that they get over it. And by concluding with an adult realization, the film lets sunlight peek through the gloom, in more ways than one. — Elvis Mitchell",19801,1

The members of this loosely knit pack eke out an existence by begging and doing occasional odd jobs for storekeepers. They sleep in a subway station on slabs of cardboard and bathe by pouring water from plastic soda bottles over their hands and faces. Most are lice-infested. The film goes out of its way not to sentimentalize its subjects. It doesn't try to impose a tight narrative structure, has no music and is more uncomfortable to watch than many documentaries because the filmmakers, who were obviously in a position to change the lives of their subjects, stand back and do nothing beyond aiming their cameras. - Stephen Holden",19814,1

The director has a fine sense of place and regards the quirks and delusions of this remote rural town with a native's mixture of affection and impatience. The film, written by Mr. Hess, a 24-year-old former student at Brigham Young University, and his 23-year-old wife, Jerusha, works best as a series of deadpan visual and verbal gags. Even the trained actors in the cast perform with the hesitant, awkward opacity of non-professionals, and their awkwardness is clearly, for Mr. Hess, a sign of authenticity. His own considerable talent could use a bit more polish. There are some dull stretches, and the fairy-tale ending does not seem entirely earned. But the picture's confidence in its own uniqueness — a quality it shares with its hero — is undeniably refreshing. — A. O. Scott",19818,1

As Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs slaughter one another in the streets, old friends become deadly enemies.

"There's a funny idea underlying this comedy directed at pre-teenagers &#151; that the C.I.A. is using sleep-away camps as covers to recruit and train young agents &#151 but Harald Zwart's film largely ignores it, preferring instead to mine the established television personas of his two young stars, Frankie Muniz (&quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;) and Hilary Duff (&quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot;).  Mr. Muniz, quivering with feigned shyness, plays the title character, a sleeper agent prodded into action when the C.I.A. chief (Keith David) and his jump-suited lieutenant (Angie Harmon) need someone to get close to a comely teen named Natalie (Ms. Duff). Natalie's scientist father (Martin Donovan) is unknowingly working for evil foreign agents with a plot to destroy America's defense system.  Most of the movie is a James Bond parody, very much in the &quot;Spy Kids&quot; manner, that owes its effectiveness to the mock-Bond sets designed by Rusty Smith. &#151; Dave Kehr",19837,1

"Now that bad taste has officially become institutionalized, this sometimes funny  — but just as often dopey — comedy has all of the anarchic charge of getting a tattoo at Wal-Mart. The movie's willingness to embarrass every single participant is almost touching. The primary victim of the movie is Scotty ((Scott Mechlowicz). At his high school graduation, he's dumped by a girl who looks as if she just stepped off the set of &quot;Smallville.&quot; Worse, the e-mail correspondence that Scotty has had with his German friend Mieke takes a very weird turn; based on his extremely limited conversational German, Scotty figures out that Mieke has just come on to him. Horrified, he blows Mieke off forever — until his younger brother tells him that Mieke is a girl's name (Scotty thinks it's the German version of Mike), and, as it follows, Mieke (Jessica Boehrs) is indeed a girl. And, yes, kids, she is hot.  Since his friends, the twins Jenny (Michelle Trachtenberg) and Jamie (Travis Webster), are headed to Europe for a summer trip, Scotty joins them so he can chase down Mieke and straighten things out. Scotty's best friend, Cooper (Jacob Pitts), tags along, in search of the kind of rampant sexual activity that he imagines is only found in more sophisticated countries. — Elvis Mitchell",19844,1

But the movie plays fast and loose with the facts, giving far too much credit to the members of a Canadian commune who took up Mr. Carter's cause and all but eliminating his heroic co-defendant John Artis from the story. And the minor characters are either saints or monsters. Yet the story of a man heroically fighting his demons and winning his freedom is still inspiring. — Stephen Holden",19856,1

"This harrowing portrait of a thirty-something business woman who succumbs to an obsession with cutting her own flesh suggests that such extreme behavior is often a  desperate attempt to re-establish a connection with the body that has been lost. Esther  (Marina de Van), the central character, finds herself on the fast track to disaster after she injures a leg while stumbling around a junk-strewn building site in the dark. She develops an intoxicated, almost cannibalistic fascination with her own torn flesh and ability to  ignore physical pain. Because the camera shares her voyeuristic fascination with her skin, the movie is often uncomfortable to watch. But the intensity of its focus on Esther's loss of control ultimately forces us to identify her behavior with whatever  embarrassing tics and eccentricities we might be struggling to conceal. A brave and scary  filmmaking debut. — Stephen Holden",19943,1

"Though set in a Taipei whose modern gleam is perpetually cloaked in mist and smog, Chen Kuo-fu's film could take place in any city whose residents have purchased material comfort and personal freedom at the cost of loneliness and anomie. This mood of melancholy settles in slowly. For most of its duration, &quot;The Personals&quot; finds humor in the emotional drift and romantic dislocation of urban life. It's an anti-romantic comedy that resolves on a minor chord of grief. The premise is as simple as the execution is elegant. A young eye doctor named Du Jiazhen (Rene Liu) disguises her identity slightly (for most of the film she's addressed as Ms. Wu) and advertises for a suitable mate. What she describes as a &quot;momentary slip&quot; and a possible &quot;route to happiness&quot; turns into a kind of sociological experiment as she meets a succession of candidates in a local tea shop. &#151; A. O. Scott",19972,1
"A movie so monumental in its stupidity that it took two studios – Warners and Columbia – to wrestle this project to the big screen. This remake of the 1961 William Castle B-picture is about a glass-walled haunted house that's really a giant containment device for unruly spirits. Once these ghosts gets free, no good can come of it – for the cast or the audience. Tony Shalhoub, Shannon Elizabeth and Alex Roberts are the family foolish enough to move into the terror site after inheriting it from an evil uncle (F. Murray Abraham, who lays on more ham that you'd find in the entire Blimpie's chain). Matthew Lillard, playing a psychic ghost hunter, comes through with an extra-charged performance; he starts falling apart in his first scene. With Rah Digga as a nanny who seems to be in the film only so she can say she doesn't do windows, a joke that's both older and scarier than the original. – Elvis Mitchell",19973,1

"Ulrich Seidl's film, which takes place during a miserably hot summer in Vienna, is a roiling mix of anger, resentment and need: the often destructive power of love. We see this in the first sequence, when the belligerently jealous Mario (René Wanko) threatens the guys who look at his girlfriend, Klaudia (Franziska Weiss); he seems to leave pools of testosterone wherever he steps. After he forces her unwanted suitors away and floors his car through the streets of Vienna, he screams at Klaudia and throws her out of the car. We then get the credit sequence, with several groups of people shown sunning themselves under the piercing sun; the pictures could be a melting mess bringing together Francis Bacon and David Hockney. With these shots of the pale cast of characters, we can almost feel the melanoma developing. Mr. Seidl treats the chemistry of human relationships like a cancer, an enormous growth that, unchecked, leads to disease. And he fixates on flesh, scouring it with his camera to search for a trace of the humanity within. He doesn't find much; the men and women in &quot;Dog Days&quot; are broken down into bullies and victims. Mr. Seidl, who wrote the screenplay with Veronika Franz, seems determined to make an answer to &quot;American Beauty.&quot; The picture is set in a tract-house suburb, with identical houses crammed next to one another, and the lack of space and the heat make an appropriate context for the wanton mistreatment. But there is genuine curiosity in Mr. Seidl's filmmaking; he treats his story as if he were shooting a documentary. The believability comes from the casting: Mr. Seidl has found a group of actors and nonprofessionals who interact spectacularly well. — Elvis Mitchell",19987,1

The gaudy, unimaginative animation is a step down from the simplicity of the series, and adults may find the cloying harmlessness oppressive.

The film, simply and efficiently shot without special effects or well-known actors, evokes some deep and primal fears, but it is ultimately too small, too under-dramatized, to provoke anything more intense than squirming discomfort. Susan and Daniel are so bland that they could be anybody, which is the problem, and your sympathy for them is fleeting, as if you had encountered them in a short, grisly item on the local evening news. — A.

"The apotheosis of glam rock in the early 1970's was David Bowie's 1972-73 Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars tour. With boldly stated gender-bending, Mr. Bowie sang in character as Ziggy wearing heavy eye shadow, teased orange hair and costumes that accentuated his slender build and spectacular gams. The final concert of the tour, on July 3, 1973, at the Hammersmith Odeon in the suburbs of London, was filmed by the veteran documentarian D. A. Pennebaker. Though &quot;Ziggy&quot; has circulated since 1983 on the midnight show circuit and was long available on video, it is only now receiving its New York theatrical premiere. It is billed as a &quot;restored version,&quot; though the sound is still fuzzy and the image only occasionally rises to the level of murk. But for fans familiar with the material, &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; should be a satisfyingly nostalgic experience. &#151; Dave Kehr",20034,1

"Karen Kusama's debut feature is a fierce, sweet, somewhat predictable boxing picture, with a novel twist that makes all the difference: the contender is a young woman. What makes the movie something more than a smart, feminist sports movie (which is already something) is the presence of Michelle Rodriguez in the leading role, an angry Brooklyn teenager named Diana Guzman who finds dignity and discipline in the ring. Ms. Rodriguez is like a female Marlon Brando, with an overpowering, slow-burning charisma that few actresses of any era can match. Her performance is a knockout. &#151; A. O. Scott",20051,1

"Even at a time of mediocre remakes, this update of Arthur Hiller's 1979  wedding/espionage caper stands out for its nearly complete lack of wit  or imagination. Michael Dounglas and Albert Brooks, taking roles originated by   Peter Falk and Alan Arkin, play Steve, a renegade C.I.A. operative, and   Jerry, a neurotic podiatrist. As the wedding (of Steve's son and Jerry's   daughter) approaches, a whole lot of worked-over espionage intrigue goes   down, involving a stray Russian nuclear submarine. Mr. Brooks at least tries to make a character out of the tics and one-liners the script  gives him, but the jokes are so inferior to the ones he might have written himself that Jerry's stricken reactions might be his own. Mr.  Douglas's rote, offhand performance is truer to the spirit of the movie,  which is a hash of tired gags and indifferently executed chases. — A. O. Scott",20053,1

Despite the practiced hand that Mr. Morrow shows with his actors, &quot;Maze&quot; becomes a vanity project bathed in poignancy. The mishmash of emotional tones can't be redeemed by the performers' considerable investment in their work. – Elvis Mitchell",20055,1

"Stephanie Black's powerful documentary illustrates with an impressive (and depressing) acuity, globalization can have a devastating impact on third world countries. The movie offers the clearest analysis of globalization and its negative effects that I've ever seen on a movie or television screen. The film focuses on the deeply troubled economy of Jamaica and how that country's long-term indebtedness to international lending organizations have contributed to the erosion of local agriculture and industry. Far from being a dry exegesis crammed with graphs, pie charts and talking heads spewing abstract mumbo-jumbo, the film goes directly to the farmers and factory workers whose livelihoods have been undermined. In basic everyday language, they explain how high interest rates have helped devalue the local currency, raising prices for their produce and permitting wealthier countries to import the same products and sell them more cheaply. &#151; Stephen Holden",20057,1

Its desperate use of sportscasters' voiceovers to explain what's happening on the screen is grating, but at least it provides some relief from the grandiose, incomprehensible speeches that make up most of Sylvester Stallone's script. -- A.

The film is a series of elegant visual jokes, interrupted by two elaborate fantasies of   vengeance and defiance, and organized around the idea that the modern Middle  East is, in unexpected and petty ways as well as the large ones we all know  about, a land of bad neighbors. &#151; A.

"The most astonishing thing about this film — a comedy that would have to work harder to even justify the appellation uninspired — is that a kick in the groin is now a joke for toddlers. They are both the target audience and the co-stars of this Eddie Murphy vehicle — more of a Big Wheel, really. In &quot;Daddy Day Care,&quot; intended for those who take their apple juice in sipping cups, Mr. Murphy is an out-of-work marketing executive with no real interest in kids outside his own son. He decides to open a day-care center with Phil (Jeff Garlin), his pal and equally fired colleague, who's a little afraid of his own son. The extremely flimsy connective tissue is Mr. Murphy, who barely bothers to do takes; he'll raise an eyebrow here and there, but he mostly uses a voice so smooth and warm, you could pour it over pancakes. And in this context — in which the very young audience is so primed to react to him as Eddie Murphy, it's surprising the kids in the cast don't call him Eddie — he can get away with it, because he knows that the movie will do most of the work for him; he's Beverly Hills Pop. You can't get more high concept, or less plotted, that this, and &quot;Daddy Day Care&quot; is proof — it's a series of trailers for Nickelodeon, most of which feature Mr. Garlin getting attacked by something angry, either kids or bees, and, probably in the sequel, kids of bees. — Elvis Mitchell",20078,1

Under the nose of the prim school principal (Joan Cusack),  Dewey, who knows nothing of academics, preaches the gospel of rock 'n' roll and secretly  converts the class from liking Christine Aguilera songs and the musical &quot;Annie&quot; to appreciating Led Zeppelin and  AC/DC. This family-friendly movie, which has big rousing &quot;Rocky&quot;-style finale and isn't  believable for a second, is a hilarious cotton-candy fantasy with a beat.

Somewhere on the multi-channel soundtrack, the voice of the actor Kiefer Sutherland can be heard reciting facts and figures about the Nascar phenomenon, but he's effectively drowned out by the roar of the engines and the visceral impact of the 3-D images.

Their lives are torn apart when their only child, a 21-year-old son, is murdered by his girlfriend's jealous husband. Learning that a legal technicality ensures that the killer will serve only a light sentence, they are beside themselves with grief, anger and mutual recrimination. In exploring the psychological processes of grief and revenge, the profoundly quiet, deeply disturbing film doesn't make a misstep. – Stephen Holden",20199,1

What makes the film so haunting and effective is the Pangs' mastery, especially evident early on, of simple, elegant shock-generating techniques. There are some computer-generated special effects, but the scariest moments are when blurry images come into focus, a process that replicates the wonder and terror that the heroine experiences as she comes to her senses and simultaneously learns not to trust them. — A.

The declamatory nature of the dialogue doesn't add texture, nor does what is some of the strangest dubbing in movie history.  Not only is there a slight but perceptible delay between the parting of lips and the sound of dialogue, but also almost each line from the actresses starts with a sharp intake of breath and ends with a girlish giggle, as if the same person were doing the voice-over for all of the women.  — Elvis Mitchell",20231,1

"Patronizing audiences may be a sure way to make money, but the resulting pictures are like writing on sand; the Japanese psychological horror film &quot;Audition&quot; has no such impermanence. With a quiet that's meticulously transformed into moodiness and then fear-filled tension, the director Takashi Miike eases us in slowly. Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi) is a widower who has raised his son by himself. This solid middle-class citizen is finally persuaded to look for a new woman in his life by a friend who has a cold-blooded idea. Aoyoma is a television producer, and the friend has him try to find someone by auditioning women under the pretext of looking for an actress for his next project. The picture is about victims, but it's also a great, sick rush with a kicker on the level of &quot;The Vanishing.&quot; &quot;Audition&quot; doesn't let you down, but bring a strong constitution — like any audition, it's a test of nerve. — Elvis Mitchell",20277,1

"This psychological horror film from the staunch, Midwestern-based independent director John D. Hancock is a sturdy, well-crafted piece that never quite overcomes the structural flaws of its story &#151; a somewhat over-plotted tale of a celebrated Hollywood animator (Alex McArthur) who falls into the hands of two cannibalistic sisters in the Michigan woods (Laura Esterman and Sage Allen).  He survives his ordeal but resolves to make a film about it, which brings him into contact with the elder sister's illegitimate daughter (Maria Cina), an actress blissfully unaware of her heritage.  The situation is creepy enough, but the screenplay, written by Mr. Hancock's wife and frequent collaborator, Dorothy Tristan, has trouble transforming the premise into genuine suspense.  The menace remains vague and unfocused until one major character makes a not entirely unexpected reappearance in the last act, at which point much of the tension has been lost. &#151; Dave Kehr",20288,1
"This precious indie weepie, adapted from a short story by Nancy Kincaid, is meticulous in disguising its sentimentality in the drab, grainy colors of kitchen-sink realism. The performances are determinedly low-key, and Isabel Coixet directs even the most emotionally charged scenes in a cool, almost affectless style, but in the end the picture amounts to little more than a morbid fantasy about the healing power of narcissism. Sarah  Polley plays Ann, a young working-class Canadian woman who discovers she has an incurable, fatal disease. Its ravages are limited to fatigue and an occasional bout of nausea, which helps shore up the movie's otherwise shaky premise, which is that terminal illness presents unparalleled opportunities for both self-fulfillment and selfless generosity. Ann makes beyond-the-grave recordings for her two young daughters and embarks on an affair with Lee (Mark Ruffalo) a melancholy, poetic fellow who haunts the local diner and Laundromat. Her decision not to tell anyone about her illness is presented as generous and liberating, and the film leaves unexplored the possibility that it might also be cruel, vain and passive aggressive. — A.

"There is probably no director more obsessed with the complexity of patriotism  — an unusual subject to plumb in mainstream films — than Edward Zwick, who is driven to question the imperatives of an America that his protagonists both love and detest.  His movie falls squarely into the realm of the previous Zwick bedeviled-hero films, &quot;Glory,&quot; &quot;Courage Under Fire&quot; and &quot;The Siege.&quot; And I do mean squarely.  &quot;Samurai&quot; is a mythic western that combines a fish-out-of-water theme with an immersion in Japanese culture: John Ford's &quot;Lost in Translation.&quot; And this time, the can-do idol of millions, Tom Cruise, uses his polished chrome smile mirthlessly. The uneven &quot;Samurai&quot; is a can-do movie that's far more effective at communicating emotion in bigger scenes than in more intimate ones. Mr. Cruise plays the burnt-out former Army officer and Indian fighter Nathan Algren. He is hired by his former commander (Tony Goldwyn) who wants Algren to travel to Tokyo and train Japanese soldiers in the use of American tactics and rifles.  Algren is forced to send his nervous, underprepared imperial troops into battle too soon against an enemy of the Emperor, the samurai Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). When a wounded Algren kills Katsumoto's second-in-command, he's captured by the invaders and, even more bewildering, cared for by Katusmoto's sister, Taka (Koyuki), the widow of the man Algren killed. Algren then learns the ways of the samurai with an alacrity that's expected of movie stars. — Elvis Mitchell",20310,1

"Using nonprofessional actors and mixing documentary and fictional techniques, the director, John Gianvito, has assembled three stories about residents of New Mexico whose lives are turned upside-down by the culture of militarism. The film, clumsily acted and awkwardly paced, is stretched out to nearly three hours by slow pans across the desert landscape and long close-ups of a man playing the oud. Mr. Gianvito's approach cannot really be called critical, since criticism would require some cogent analysis of causes and events. Rather, he seems to be working from a set of vague but unshakable assumptions about American politics and culture, and he has built his overstated, unconvincing stories from these assumptions rather than from observation and reflection. &#151; A.

"Jim Carrey embodies the scary possibility that at heart every human being is a sugar-crazed 6-year-old hellion gleefully wreaking  havoc in Mommy and Daddy's fastidiously decorated living room. In this  rambunctiously funny comedy, his alter ego, Bruce Nolan, a frustrated television newscaster in Buffalo relegated to human-interest stories, gets to rampage at the loftiest spiritual level.  At Bruce's darkest moment, God himself (Morgan Freeman) comes to the rescue and invites  Bruce, who has been loudly cursing the heavens, to try his hand at running the universe  while He takes a break. Chaos ensues. Mr. Carrey's infantile Almighty is selfish,  capricious and short-sighted, and delights in cruel practical jokes. Jennifer Aniston is Bruce's  loyal girlfriend and Mr. Freeman's deity a wry, mischievous sage with a laissez-faire  attitude toward the world. — Stephen Holden",20409,1

"This lovely, uncomplicated, though limited, movie is a shaggy dog story &#151; well, actually, a shaggy animal story. The title isn't a metaphor (though the story itself is). The filmmakers have actually made a film about a pale and needy newborn camel whose mother ignores it.  After a difficult birth, the mother abandons her calf, refusing to nurse it. In the wrong hands &#151; probably any other hands &#151; &quot;Camel&quot; would drip with stickiness, and it verges on being an old-school live-action Disney feature. Yet Byambasuren Davaa and Luigi Falorni deny us the easiness of narration that spells out what their cameras are ably, and simply, filming. They have said they were inspired by the pioneering documentarian Robert Flaherty. This movie follows Flaherty's mission to capture traditions of cultures far from his own. Though similar in motivation, it is modest and leisurely, rather than epic and obsessive like Flaherty's films. The filmmakers' patience and the quality of the images they obtain give a mellow contentment to the project, a thoughtful and honest serenity that is passed on to viewers. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",20417,1

In remembering the good old days of plumbers and White House tape recordings, this extended, wildly funny &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;-style sketch spares no one.

"Like most corporate animation pictures, Fox's &quot;Ice Age&quot; is about abandonment. A human baby is left behind by his tribe, which is fleeing &#151; along with much of the rest of animal life &#151; as the Ice Age approaches. Sid the sloth (the voice of John Leguizamo) convinces Manfred, a woolly mammoth (Ray Romano), that they have to return the child to his family. Diego, a scheming saber-toothed tiger (Denis Leary), joins them. Because it lacks the comic sophistication of pictures like &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;  and &quot;Shrek,&quot; this blandly likable computer-animation extravaganza actually seems like a fossil, a relic from another era. &quot;Ice Age&quot; plays more like a movie for very young children.

As the movie, which has only the haziest grasp of narrative coherence,  jumps from one setting to the next, characters make unprepared entrances and exits, and  some disappear without a trace. Dramatic confrontations have no consequences. The  dialogue is so quirky that it's sometimes unintelligible. Worse, its two stars, Jonathan Tucker  and Rachael Leigh Cook, never transcend their characters' limitations to become  compelling. &#151; Stephen Holden",20447,1

The two most notorious scenes in the South Korean movie, which created a stir on the international film festival circuit, are both gory suicidal gestures involving fishhooks inserted into orifices. Obviously &quot;The Isle&quot; is a movie of extremes, and that goes for its aesthetics. As gory as the scenes of torture and self-mutilation may be, they are pitted against shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an Asian landscape painting. — Stephen Holden",20458,1

"The heroine of Todd  Stephen's independent film is Gypsy Vale (the talented Sara Rue of the television series &quot;Less than Perfect&quot;), a large woman of 25 who wears her Goth uniform to work at the Foto Hut in a Sandusky, Ohio, shopping mall; she lives with her father (John Doe), but dreams of going to New York, following in the fleet footsteps of her mother, who abandoned her family to pursue her rock star dreams. Gypsy is abetted in her fantasies by Clive (Kett Turton), a gay teenager who shares her taste in fashion and music &#151;  they are both worshippers of Stevie Nicks &#151;  and designs Gypsy's makeup and costumes.  When the pair learns of a Stevie Nicks impersonator competition to be held at a New York nightclub, they hop into Gypsy's black TransAm and hit the road &#151;  wearing full Goth regalia, which causes them some predictable problems with the assorted truckers, frat boys and small town folks they meet on the way. Mr. Stephens, who also directed the independent film &quot;Edge of Seventeen,&quot; has filled &quot;Gypsy 83&quot; with rough language, strong sex talk and a couple of fairly explicit sexual encounters, but its edginess is as easily washed away as Clive's black lipstick.  This is a tiny, vulnerable, rather treacly film at heart, one that would probably float away were it not for Ms. Rue's generous presence. &#151; Dave Kehr",20503,1

"Ilya Chaiken's &quot;Margarita Happy Hour&quot; is an independent feature with sure sociological instincts.  Here is one substratum of New York society that has not previously been documented — the single mothers, whose decision not to terminate unplanned pregnancies have left them facing the unexpected end of their lives of impulse and irresponsibility. The rock 'n' roll moms gather most afternoons at the tables in front of an anonymous bar in a bohemian quarter of Brooklyn.  Much of the film, which Ms. Chaiken wrote and directed, is devoted to group-dialogue scenes, in which the women boozily debate their Medicaid problems and the limited romantic possibilities available to women with young children. — Dave Kehr",20583,1

"Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Warren Schmidt, a retired, insurance executive from Omaha at loose ends after the death of his wife, may be the most astonishing dramatic transformation of his 44-year screen career. Plodding in a weary, stiff-legged shuffle, this great actor reins in his bad-boy mannerisms to convey a deep, sorrowful awareness of human complexity. As the movie follows the attempts of this staid 66-year-old everyman to regain his equilibrium, it sustains an exquisite balance between a satire of Middle American life and the wrenching pathos of Warren's situation, as he tries to form a bond with his resentful grown-up daughter (Hope Davis). Much of the story takes place on the road from Nebraska to her wedding in Colorado. Kathy Bates has a flashy comic turn as the groom's garrulous, overbearing mother. — Stephen Holden",20602,1

The movie holds few surprises; you always know where it's going, and sometimes you can predict exactly what the characters are going to say. But Daldry finds honest feeling and dramatic integrity in shopworn material, and the cast, notably Gary Lewis as Billy's father, Julie Walters as his teacher, and young Jamie Bell as Billy himself, help rescue the movie from its most hackneyed impulses. — A.

"Jim Jarmusch, who fits right into Neil Young's world of defiant artistic purity and try-anything abandon, has made a documentary that the faithful are sure to love. What a sight the 52-year-old Grandpa of Grunge is, stomping around the stage in saggy shorts, baggy T-shirt and black socks, hitting on a riff and playing it over and over until it brings on a trance. And in between musical sequences, Jim Jarmusch finds a visual form that mirrors the spirit of the music. All in all, great sounds and a loose, good-humored tribute to Neil Young's 30 years of maverick rock-and-roll. &#151; Janet Maslin",20616,1

A fertile concept vanishes behind confused, overwrought style. Mr. Strom's subject is the Jewish Autonomous Region of the Soviet Union, founded by Stalin in 1934 as a homeland for Russia's Jews. An area of 14,000 square miles in eastern Siberia on the border with China, it still survives as a member state of the Russian Federation, though Jews now make up only 5 percent of the population. &#151; Dave Kehr",20619,1

"&quot;Jackpot&quot; is the elusive pot of gold that Sunny Holiday (Jon Gries) is searching for. He's barely a step above the down and out, working the karaoke circuit. He views it as a way to leapfrog into singing his own songs. Like &quot;Twin Falls, Idaho,&quot; the  first film by Michael and Mark Polish, &quot;Jackpot&quot; — Michael directed and wrote the script with Mark  —  is redolent of desperation, delusion and kitsch. The filmmakers are more willing to wink knowingly at creepiness than anyone this side of David Lynch. And despite its few very funny scenes, and the newest digital technology, which gives the film an appropriate left-on-the-dashboard faded look, the picture lacks balance, shifting clumsily from comedy to melodrama. The tone of the picture is as wobbly as Sunny's ability to stay on key; and it seems to be just as predatory as he is toward women hungry for affection. - Elvis Mitchell",20628,1

"''Back to the Future'' meets ''Field of Dreams'' meets ''It's a Wonderful Life'' meets ''The Sixth Sense'' in this entertaining but shamelessly sentimental supernatural soap opera with a macho heart. Jim Caviezel is a morose young policeman who contacts his dead father, a heroic firefighter, on a ham radio and contrives to save him from the accident that cost him his life during the 1969 World Series. From here, the two collaborate on changing other aspects of the past and on catching a serial killer. There are enough testosterone tears to soak Shea Stadium. &#151; Stephen Holden",20630,1

When mysterious designs begin to appear in the vast cornfields behind his house, he must confront the possibility that there are no accidents, and rediscover his faith to protect his two children and his feckless younger brother (Joaquin Phoenix). There are also some aliens to contend with. M. Night Shyamalan once again demonstrates his impressive technical skill as a suspense director, micromanaging the audience's dread with deft cuts and camera movements. But with each movie, it seems, his sentimentality becomes more grandiose, and this movie's carefully constructed surprise ending feels less like a revelation than a hoax. — A. O. Scott",20639,1

Unfortunately, Billie lives in the not-so-classic Queens of 2001, where her romantic choices consist of an uptight corporate lawyer (Cameron Bancroft) and a gifted but temperamental musician (Andrew McCarthy).  &quot;Anything but Love,&quot; which was written by Ms. Rose and Robert Cary and directed by Mr. Cary, is anything but unpredictable, but it is a pleasant, good-natured picture that struggles, gallantly if vainly, to recapture the style and sensibility of a studio musical on the severely limited budget of an independent film. &#151; Dave Kehr",20654,1

"The movie spinoff from the outrageous Comedy Central cartoon series following the adventures of some potty-mouthed third-grade boys in South Park, Colo., is extremely funny and jubilantly obscene, with several sewers' worth of bathroom humor. It is also a smart, pointed satire that demolishes the hypocrisy of a conservative culture that allows almost unlimited violence and gore in movies and on television but goes ballistic at the prospect of children's being exposed to dirty language and sexual explicitness. When a group of tykes sneak into a Canadian movie filled with obscenities and come home spewing smut, their parents raise such a ruckus that the United States declares war on Canada. Armageddon looms when the Devil, who has been having a troubled affair with the recently deceased Saddam Hussein, decides to put in an appearance.

No, this is not a great movie, but it is something that these days seems almost as rare: a well-made, clever comedy that balances low humor with fizzy mock-sophistication and that doesn't depend entirely on the genitals and the lower digestive track for its humor. Weaver shows her considerable comic gifts, Hewitt makes comic use of her considerable physical gifts, and Gene Hackman and Ray Liotta nearly steal the show. — A. O. Scott",20671,1
